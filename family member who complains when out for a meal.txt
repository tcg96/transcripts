There's far too many choices. ...Look at that! £6. £6 for beans on toast. ...No, I don't want to go anywhere else. We're here now.
This didn't use to be a restaurant. Did you know that? It used to be flats. And I knew a girl that lived here. She was my friend, I would come and visit her. But uh... I don't speak to her anymore. No, we fell out. To be honest I don't even know if she's alive or not... and I don't really care.
Can you stop texting, please, while we're having a family meal? ...Because it's rude. ... Oh, is that mine? Hang on.
That young man who's just served us is very handsome, do you not think? You should give him your mobile number. ...You don't want to? Well, do whatever you want then. He probably wouldn't want you anyway with your table manners. Get your elbows down off the table now. Put them down, we're not at a zoo.
Well, I think that was very overpriced for what we ordered, yes. ...Hello. Yes, we are ready to pay, thank you. "How was the food?" Oh, it was just lovely.
