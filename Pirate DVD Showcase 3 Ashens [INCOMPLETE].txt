- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Stuart.
- I've gotten pretty good at tracking these things from the charity shops of Norwich and beyond.
- Is there something beyond Norwich?
- Apparently.

- Let's start with popular classic..."G". I have genuinely never heard of this film. It's a movie about a gangster guy...?
- It's about "a dangerously deceptive love triangle even money cantflx".
- So, Cantflix is like Netflix, but it only shows programs by Brian Cant?
- I would assume so.
- Or is it the Netflix that doesn't work? At the bottom there is some writing in Chinese, because that is the market this was made for. "A young Great Gatsby-ish hip-hopper"... Hip-hopper? Was this written by a 50-year-old?
- "COMPLEX TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP BREAK!!! But a quietly staged tragedy". I like how it holds it together for the first half of the blurb, but then it can't take it anymore.
- I hope it's actually like that in the film. Just a big anime explosion. "Complex Triangular Relationship Break!" The actual disc is high quality, it's a DVD clone! Perfectly good quality DVD clone! So if you bought this in the markets of Shenzhen or wherever, you'd probably be doing all right, but you might get more entertainment out of the writing on the back. Not because the film is necessarily bad, it's just that's fucking hilarious.

- Now here is one that I haven't shown to Alec as yet. He spotted this in the charity shop and texted me and I picked it up, for I happened to be in City Centre at the time. I've had this for sodding months. I shall let you discover the joys of...The Dark Knight.
- What? "Bought it for son as he request"? Wow!
- It was the spine that alerted him.
- "BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT". It's not the name of the film.
- Also, incredibly low quality logo there.
- This is a treat.
- Go on, read us the additional details.
- Commentary by director David Fincher...by "Diroctor David Finchor"! "Diroctor David Finchor".
- I worked out what's happened! They've used some sort of OCR program, but it's missed...it's mistaken many of the E's, or these lowercase E's for O's.
- Wow. All praise Lord Finchor.
- Also, he didn't direct this film.
- No, he definitely didn't.
- "Commontary by Jako Gyllonhall". Was he one of the Animaniacs?
- Wow. "Jako Gyllonhall".
- "Robert Brad Fishor, James Vandorbitt, Jamos".
- You've got those lovely "Dol-e-tod Scones".
- "Dole-tod Scones".
- Scones!
- "Doletod Scones: Zodiac Deciphorod"...
- I believe this is taken from the cover for Zodiac.
- You are absolutely correct. "Visual Effocts of Zodiac", "Previsualization", disappointingly correct.
- "This is the Zodiac Spoaking".
- That's that fucking guy from 'Allo 'Allo! "Good Moaning, this is the Zodiac Spoaking".
- "His name is Arthur Loigh Allen, Moro". I don't think it was.
- "Moro", I worked out, I think is "More".
- Ah. Well, this is proper shit, isn't it? Geez, Louise.
- And on the bottom, you can't even make any of the names out, but I worked out it's just cut and pasted from the bottom of Zodiac!
- Which this film definitely isn't. Well, I'm sure the son who requested that...
- I don't know what he requested or what he was bought. Perhaps that's what you find out in the film!
- "Thank you. It's what I've always wanted." Is this the son?
- "Thank you, Mothor!" Well, at least they put some effort in.
- They...they did that.

- Now here's a film that anyone would want. The existence of this baffles me.
- Jaws 2. That absolute non-classic. "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water". It was not a good film, was it?
- No. We came up with a better one!
- We did! On our Sequelisers podcast! Look below for the link! Listen to us! Coming up with better ideas to disappointing sequels to good movies.
- That's a good plug. I like the way you did that.
- Thanks, I've been practising for weeks...actually, no I haven't, I came up with that immediately off the top of me head. Right. "The ultimate high-def movie experience".
- "Experienc".
- Oh, yeah. In "experienc". So they have literally cut that off to fit it in this ultra-slim...
- Put that on your shelf! This is just a photocopy of the North American DVD release, with a load of lies and bollocks written over the top of it.
- I'm going to guess there's no digital copy.
- There was no digital copy, it is not a dual-layer DVD-9...I don't even think it has a DTS soundtrack, so I think that is also a lie.
- Good old case on this one. "GT Pro"! That's what we like. In fact, according to my notes here, it is a DVD clone...but the picture is squashed down to a box in the middle and it's really low bit rate. Just when you thought it was safe to put it back in your DVD player, my God.

- Now, here is a film that I haven't seen yet, despite having seen both of the sequels.
- You should watch it because it's pretty good.
- I think so, but probably not this copy. ...Cloverfield! "Some Thing has found us". Wait, this looks a bit hastily typeset. "The movie is exactly the length of a DV tape and it shows pieces of the Statue of Liberty that come raining down. So, I went to a 5 pm showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I liked how the characters developed over the course of the story." Nice. This is how all covers should be, with that one exception.
- One man's opinion.
- Inside, there are a lot of details, if you want to learn about Mike Vogel in Chinese. He was also in a film called Open Graves, apparently. What the fuck? There's another one! "Yo dawg, we heard you liked DVD inlays, so we put a DVD inlay in your DVD inlay". It's exactly the same. No, the writing here is only in English, the Chinese bit is omitted. Same text up there, I suppose.

- Tell you what? Let's look at another one. Oh! It's the Nees..."DVD Video"? That's from a UMD, surely.
- Yeah. They've taken the UMD video cover template and stretched it to DVD size.
- Nice. Nice. No wonder he looks so pissed off. "I have a special set of skills, and it involves scaling bitmaps."
- Photoshop.
- My god, it's actually worse at the back, look. Go on, read us the plot summary.
- "A former spy must use his skills to rescue his estranged daughter, who is kidnapped and forced into the slave trade." The End.
- That's...that's what happens. You can't argue with that. He gets more stretched as the film goes on, apparently. Starring all proper things..."Japans...Japanes subtitles throughout film DVD quality". What is the disc like? It is literally a blank DVD! What, look, there's almost no data on it!
- Yep. High quality.
- With this tiny sticker they haven't even centred properly!
- It's got part of the cover repeating itself.
- The bit rate is super low, and of course, there are hard-coded Japanese subtitles, as they do allude to. It's probably the worst way possible to watch Taken. The best thing about Taken for me is that his daughter has run off to follow fucking U2 on tour. Like kids love a bit of dad rock, I mean, what the hell? Makes no sense to me whatsoever.
- I would like to see a film where Liam Neeson gives up his career as a man with a particular set of skills to follow U2 on tour. It's just Liam Neeson's mid-life crisis.
- Sold. Let's get down to the production office and make this happen. I'm pretty sure Liam Neeson will appear in anything that smells like an action film. That's exactly how the film industry works. ...That's dangerously accurate, actually.
