- Hey Kate. Kate!
- ...What?
- Your hair is orange!
- What are you talking about?
- Look at your hair!
- ...Oh my god, no no no no no no no no! I'm using Sun In, that's for blonde hair, not orange! How bad does it look?
- Not bad. You're more Carrot Top, less Lindsey Lohan.
- This is worse than when Sarah removed me from her top 8! I have to go find my mom!
