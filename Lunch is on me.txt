- By the way, lunch is on me.
- Are you sure?
- Ah, you got it last time. I got this one.
- Cool, thanks.
- Can I get you ladies something to drink?
- Yeah, can I get a sweet tea?
- Ahem.
- Okay, and for you?
- ...I'll just have a water, please.
- All right, and are you starting with an appetizer today?
- Um, I don't know. What do you--
- No. No thank you. We're good.
- Okay. I'll give you some time with the menu.
- Thank you.
- Ahem.
- Ahem.
- ...So, do you know what you're going to get?
- Well, I was going to do the ravioli, but since you got the sweet tea, I'll probably just stick with the tomato salad.
- Wait, what?
- I just don't want to go crazy.
- Oh. I can just cover myself, it's really not a big deal.
- No, no. It's okay.
- Are we ready to order?
- Yeah. I'll, um... I'll just have the house salad.
- Ahem.
- Okay, do you want chicken on it?
- Uh, sure.
- ðŸ™„
- Got it. And for you?
- Well, I guess I'll just be having the seeds.
- What?
- Seeds.
- What kind--
- Get the seeds.
- Okay.
- I don't have to eat...
- No, no! No. Seriously, no.
