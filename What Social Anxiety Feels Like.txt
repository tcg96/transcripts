- ...The doctor said it was just a bizarre case of shingles.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- That's terrible.
- I know.
- I'm going to go refill that ice.
- No, no, no. Stop bringing up your sad shingles story!
- Oh, no. Anxiety, why are you here? I really wanted to go to this party alone.
- And now you're just standing here? Get your phone out, look busy!

- What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you want people to see you doing that?
- Doing what? Eating?
- Yes. Oh, my God. People are going to see how you eat.

- You've been looking at that alone for way too long. People are going to realize that you only know the host like some kind of a weird loner. Enter a conversation!

- Stop! Can't you see they don't want to talk to you?
- Yeah, I guess.

- Stop! They figure they don't want to talk to you either!
- Okay.

- Are you fucking crazy? He doesn't want to be cornered by you! And what would you even say? It'd be so awkward!
- Well, I'm sorry, anxiety, but everyone seems off-limits.

- Hi. I'm Zac, this is my friend Siobhan.
- I'm Katie. How do you guys know Cynthia?
- Cynthia...
- They hate what you're wearing and they know you're lame. You're going to ruin this conversation. Get out now! Say you're hungry.
- Mmm, I'm hungry.
- Oh, me too. I think I'm going to go make a plate.
- Oh. I'll come with!
- You idiot! Now it looks like you've latched onto them!
- Actually, I'm not. Never mind.
- Great. You left them to stand in a corner. Now they think you're rude.

- Your third drink? People are going to think you're an alcoholic.

- Yeah, I'm just like...Red Solo cups, why are they so popular?
- Terrible topic, but thank God you're finally talking to someone. ... Wait. That's her landlord! He just responded to a noise complaint! You shouldn't be talking to him!

- Hey. Have you guys...? Sorry, guys. Does anybody here have a vacation story that could be fun...? Anybody?
- No one is talking to you. You don't belong here. You should just go home right now.
- Hey, has anybody here been to Iceland ever?
- Oh, God, no. Play it off as a joke. Show them you can laugh at yourself!
- And watch me trip, and watch me bang me, and watch me trip, trip, and watch me bang me...
- I'm not with her.
