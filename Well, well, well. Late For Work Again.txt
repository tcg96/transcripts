- Where were you?
- Siobhan.
- Work starts at 9 am, it is 11:30, where were you?
- Oh. Huh... I was at the dentist.
- You're going to the dentist a lot lately.
- Yeah, soda.
- Your mouth sore?
- Boy, gum stuff.
- It's funny, because I was at the dentist earlier and I didn't see you there.
- So was I.
- Cynthia, hey. Yeah, I didn't actually make it to the dentist. Uh...I had car trouble, you know these cars.
- Don't you lie to us, Grant.
- We're not stupid.
- We waited all morning for you. ... We've burnt breakfast.
- You didn't have to do that.
- What are we supposed to do to get through to you?
- Are you drunk?
- Don't change the subject.
- I won't talk to you when you're like this.
- You never want to talk.
- Are you guys fighting?
- Go back to your room, sweetheart. ... Fine. You want to know why I was late? I was in bed with her.
- With who?!?
- With Her, the Spike Jonze movie. It was my third time watching it, and I did it on my phone, on my side, in my bed, that's why I was late.
- You...bastard.
- That's always why I'm late, because I hate getting out of bed, so I will find any excuse to stay.
- Shut up.
- Last week when I was late, I was looking up driving directions for a trip I'm taking in four months. ... And yesterday, I was late because I was playing online practice craps.
- Do you think we like getting up early? Do you think we're on time because this is so much fun for us? No. We're here because we have to be, because we're committed!
- I don't have time for this, I have work to do.
