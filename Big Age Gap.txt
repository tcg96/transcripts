- Hi. I've got a date coming and I'm trying to impress her. Bring out a cup of wine flight, something mid-tier. And she's going to look young, but she's 21. She's in college. I'm dating a sexy young co-ed, so be on the lookout for that. Carissa, hi! I'm...
- Damn, this place is fancy. Are they doing like drink specials or something?
- It's not that kind of place.
- It's cool, I got us covered. Do you want any? It tastes like ass, but it gets you fucked up.
- Oh, you don't need to do that. I'll buy you a drink. Can we get some more waters?
- Right, I totally forgot. I'm sorry, I've, like, never been on a date with an old dude.
- I'm actually only 38.
- Oh, dope! That's how old my grandma was when my mom had me in 1997. Oh, sick! Double fisting!
- No, you don't actually...ha. There it goes.
- What is that, vodka cran?
- No, this is a wine flight. So, first, you're going to aerate...
- Sorry, this is, like, really boring, and I'm getting really bored. Let's talk about something fun. Do you have any exes that you hate?
- Well, I'm divorced. I don't know that I hate her.
- Cool, so, we're like both just out of relationships. Yeah, I dated this guy, Brent, for like three weeks, but he lives in my dorm, so it just went like really fast, you know?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Mmm. This salsa is muy ba√±o.
- I think you mean bueno, and it's beluga caviar.
- I'm pretty sure they sell this up in the cafeteria at Geller Hall.
- I've never been there, but they don't.
- We should just, like, get in a car and drive. ...Just, like, go.
- Where?
- What's stopping us? What's holding us back?
- I have work on Monday.
- Just skip. I can get out of my classes. All I have is Intro to Psych, and I'm failing anyways. Let me just email my professor.
- Don't do that. You don't need to do that. Stop typing the email.
- Cool. I told him my grandpa died, which is kind of messed up, 'cause he's pretty healthy for his age. He's, like, probably three years older than you.
- You know what, Carissa? I am really feeling the age gap here. I don't think it's going to work. I'm an adult, you were born in 1997, was it? You think that caviar is salsa, which is insane...
- Do you want to go back to my place and hook up?
- Yes, absolutely.
