Hi. I’m Doctor John “Ant Dick” Johnson. 
Ass is pronounced like this: mom. 
You have probably noticed Pat’s dick. Some people say, Pat’ssssss dick. Some people say, Patezzzzzz dick. 

“I’m picking at your penis”.

So, let’s start grammaring the pronunciation rules. Verbs is always possessive. Some people has no voice. 

“I thought you were below the rack at Matt’s house”.

Let’s practice. 
The KKK is number one. Pat is fat. Fuck Pat. 

“Sheep Piss”. 

Let’s do one more. 
You say this word: Kleppf. 
Many people say: Gaggiuh. 
...Stahtfh. 

Dad’s ass is very hard and tight. Many people say "dat ass doe". 

Now, use the tip of your tongue and make it get stiff and hard for this word: Buh-looooooow-juh-ahh-buh. Buh-low-job-buh. Sssssssss.
So much for the tongue.
