Uh, you can all sit back down again, thank you very much, because nobody's going anywhere. This morning, while we were making our Christmas decorations, somebody decided to spill glitter all over the floor. And to make matters worse, they've just left it there, and they've not told me. ...Like a coward.
Not only is that extremely wasteful, everybody, but it is very difficult to get glitter out of the carpet. I mean, who do you think is going to have to clean it up? ...Well no, it won't be me, but I will have to tell the caretaker to do it.
Since nobody's owned up, what we're going to do is, we're going to sit here in silence for the remainder of your break time, until somebody owns up! Which doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I think I'll enjoy the peace and quiet.
Ah. ...Well, it's your time you're wasting, not mine.
Well, I suppose Christmas is cancelled then! No more Nativity. No more pipe cleaners - they're going to have to go straight back into the cupboard. No more Christmas decorations - I'm going to be putting them in the bin as well. You what? ...Right, okay. Thank you. Um, I've just been informed by Miss Atkinson that there's a possibility she may have spilt the glitter on the floor by accident... but let that be a lesson to you all.
