Hey, Internet citizens. It's me, Harry Pancake, the CEO of Tumblr. We've begun the difficult process of removing all adult content from our platform. We know some of our users are unhappy with this decision. But Tumblr's a family company, and there's so much that we do have to offer that is SFW, short for safe, fun, and wholesome.
We're still having fun, come on.
Tumblr's a vibrant space for artists, comedians, young activists, and the many non-pornographic communities that make up our platform. Consider the thriving mascot community we have here on Tumblr. These sports-heads can't get enough of their team's mascots. If you spend any time at all scrolling under the "furry" hashtag, you'll be wowed at their craftsmanship...ingenuity...and...dedication...whoa...

- What am I looking at here, Carm? Because that, uh...So you're telling me I'm looking at this lion, I guess, centaur, penetrating this lady koala from behind. That is not indicative of what the furry community is about.
- It extremely is.
- What? Okay, so you're telling me if I go to yiff-party...
- Don't do it.

- So the entire furry community is just these foxes and badgers and dragons all banging each other? I...
- Well, dragons call themselves "scalies".
- Do you think that was my question, was what the nomenclature of these fucking...? What is this frog doing with its nipples...How does this not violate our extremely clarified nipple policy?
- Well, frogs normally don't have nipples, so we couldn't tell if they were female-presenting.
- The frog's got tits out to here, Carmen! I've never seen bigger tits in my life!
- I've seen bigger.
- Where?
- Tumblr.
- Go to hell!

Tumblr's about creativity, not smut. Look at the great fan-created fiction that's already on here.
Sherlock Holmes as a high school student? Shared over 800,000 times.
The untold adventures of Samwise and Frodo, sharing a villa in the Tuscan countryside? How creative is that?
Here, I want to read you a passage from one of my favorite fan-created fictions, Harry Potter and the Wand of Impossible Girth. "But I don't understand, Dobby, I gave you my sock. Why do you want the rest of my clothes? Dobby gripped the tender balls of the Boy Who Lived, and whispered, Dobby is master now, and Cornelius Fudge gets to watch." I...

- Conservatively, what percentage of our platform is porn?
- Nine...
- Nine percent?
- Ninety...
- Ninety?
- ...-eight.

Martha, I'm not angry, I just am trying to understand how this didn't get to me. When I started this website, I wanted it to be about buddies doing social media. That's why I started the BDSM tag! ...It's full of what?!?
Well, it can't all be porn! Okay? It can't all be porn! There's got to be some not-porn on the platform! Activists, we have got young activists. Head over to socialist...put up socialist Tumblr, and I bet there's...Cute, that's real cute, gang. So, what? This is seizing the means of production?
I will find it. I will find the non-porn, alright? Cooking! Look, this eggplant is sprinkling water on a crying man...no!
Family, okay, family values. "Thirsty stepsister needs a big"...no, she doesn't need that. And in fact, nobody needs that.
Something boring, something boring, uh...Craftsmanship, DIY. Here, "watch a hydraulic press crush my quivering virgin asshole".

- Why is everyone on the Internet so horny?!? Why is nobody obeying rule 34, be polite?
- That's not rule 34.
- Is there a different rule 34?
- A very different rule 34.
- So you're telling me that if I put in any...any...anything, uh, uh, Bronson Pinchot, Perfect Strangers. "Street guy first time anal bareback that"...

It's twelve million results, it's twelve million results. That's the real Bronson Pinchot. Well, he's working.
Well, I don't understand what the octopus is getting out of any of this. And frankly, the young woman doesn't look very happy, either. And this is under the "cartoons" tag! Yabba-dabba-do not search under there if you want to just watch some Flintstones, or something wholesome!
Well, I guess I'm the idiot, right? Just a fool who wanted a web site, some artsy photos of rain, a couple of bad poems, and a conversation format that was frankly impossible to follow. You took my dream and you stuffed it up with dicks and pussies and hard clits.

- We found a non-porn post!
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a Neo-Nazi advocating genocide. Should we take this down too?
- I beg your pardon? Freedom of speech, heard of it?
