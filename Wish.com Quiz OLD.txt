- Welcome to Barshens, and this is a quiz called "Be Careful What You Wish For". Shall we talk about what you guys wish for, or shall we just crack on?
- Umm...you could do. It depends if you think the format needs a bit of extra padding in the start.
- It might do, to be fair.
- Okay.
- What do you wish for?
- I wish for...peace on Earth, and goodwill to voles.
- Hmm. What about you?
- I wish to go on the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios.

Barshens!

- Are you guys familiar with the concept of Wish.com?
- Oh, Wish.com! They sell you tat for cheap!
- Anything you could imagine, and I mean anything, exists on Wish.
- Eli's...beans?
- My beans exist in China.
- What we're going to have is a bunch of things that I've found on the Wish web site, and the idea is you have to guess what its purpose is. Simple as that. And also, you have your Speed Knob card. If you can pass these out...
- Why has mine got pubes and the others haven't?
- I've got a pointy pee-pee.
- And there's something going on with the testicles there I don't like, as well.
- One of the items from Wish may or may not be a sex toy.
- Oh!
- Before you guess that that's the sex toy, play your Speed Knob card, and that's a chance for you to get an extra bonus point. Shall we do the quiz?
- Please.

Wish.

- Fucking hell!
- A lot squeezy.
- Hang on.
- This is six examples of the same item.
- Yeah. I think both me and Barry know what this is.
- Yeah. You put that on a saucepan, on the lip of it, and it lets some steam go out and lets the lid rest on it.
- Why would you...? Just take the fucking lid off!
- It's a novelty gift thing, for people who like cooking, you see.
- You like what? Letting a bit of steam, but not all the steam off?
- Yeah.
- It's not what they're advertising it for, because this sort of weird sex party of little tiny men was basically another clue. But your answer is that's their primary purpose, so, yeah. Basically I've fucked it already, haven't I?
- Welcome to Barshens! You obviously haven't been listening when you were recording the sound.
- Should I play my sex card? I'm confused now.
- Does anybody want to have a guess of another purpose that these could be useful, which is what it's primarily being sold as, on Wish?
- Coat hanger.
- Human Centipede...replica.
- It was primarily a chopstick holder, but since I've fucked it...
- Oh, but it doesn't really work as a chopstick holder! What a bizarre thing!
- Welcome to Wish! Points all round!
- Yay!
- Chopsticks are sexy.
- Okay.
- Next one.
- Next one...

Wish.

- This is just one...it's not very difficult. What do you think that is?
- I think you put your fingers and thumbs in it...
- Yeah, like an exerciser.

I think for people who were
gonna go and present children's programs
of cloth puppets is it fake chewing gum
could you talk it through that person
put in a few changed spit it out with
you don't give it rinse what's the
purpose of the howls you can sit your
tongue for our tongue trainer now can
you carry beer bottles with it yeah beer
bottles you stick a bunch of beer
bottles through it and then you can
carry a bunch

- No, because there's no bit to hold it as a handle by.
- Two points for Ryan and Stuart. It's a bit sexy, but it's not really a sex toy.

Wish.

- It's a rubber chicken and it makes a squeaky noise and it's for a dog.
- Dog toy, yeah.
- I think it is, indeed, obviously a fake chicken, yeah, you can't deny that bit, but I think it's an electronic one. I think you press the button and it makes chicken noises or squeaks electronically.
- There's a thing around its neck, so you can take the head off, and it's for seasoning a chicken, and you put some stuff in there, maybe put...
- Ryan's got two points!
- Fuck off!
- It's actually called the Crock Coq.
- Put their flavour into your dish.

Wish.

- Oh!
- That is...
- I know what that is. I know what that is. Is that...? Yeah, I'm going to chuck this in.
- Oh, no! Oh, no.
- Interesting! So, do you want to walk us through that?
- I think that's a "wankerchief".
- Oh, my God.
- I think that's a "wankerchief", where somebody puts their stem around it, and then they release their pollen, after agitating the stem, and then the pollen is collected in the handkerchief, the "wankerchief".
- No. That is for solo hair and face shaving; it collects the hairs. You stick your head through there, it collects the hairs.
- Exactly. I did wonder at first if it was some sort of evil sex swing, but then I noticed those small suction cups would not hold the weight of a human.
- So, I think this goes on the mirror, and your barber, or yourself, cuts your hair.
- Yeah, I think you're right.
- One point for everyone, except Barry, who's disgusting.
- The "wankerchief" is a good invention though.
- What's the "wankerchief"?
- Oh, we've just invented it, haven't we?
- Like that, but...dick through it.
- You put that around your "schtem"...
- Your "schtem".
- And then you put your suckers on the wall, so you've got a good surface area...
- Barry, your agent right now is just...

Wish.

- Oh.
- They look like punctured testicles.
- There's only one picture for this.
- Kidney warmers. ... Giant golden beans.
- They kind of look almost like a prosthetic, you sort of put on, then put make-up over, but I don't think so. It could be, like, pads you put your shoes on, if your shoes are uncomfortable.
- Would they be that small though?
- Oh, yeah, they're tiny! For people with really small feet.
- Eyebrows.
- Yeah.
- Flattened banana.
- Flattened bananas, that's what they are.
- Flattened banana flakes.
- Answers?
- Flattened banana cake!
- Stu?
- I think they are for protecting part of your hand...?
- These are ear protectors for when you go swimming.
- They're all lovely answers, and they're actually all a lot more sensible than reality, which is...
- Oh!
- You put them on your eyes and they make you look intensely startled.
- A bit like a superhero.
- Probably does nothing.
- No, they do absolutely nothing.

Wish.

- I know exactly what this is, because I have owned two.
- It has two functions.
- Wine stopper.
- Yeah, it's a wine stopper, is what it's sold as, and it's called Happy Man. Somebody has sent them to the PO box.
- And it will make them fizzy...
- Yeah, it's a fizz stopper and a wine keeper.
- There's a second picture.
- Yeah. I quite like the twin ring.
- Oh, is it his penis that extends into the bottle?
- Yeah.
- How brilliant.
- His penis is very high up.
- That's a different one! That's a separate item.
- It's a bottle opener.

Wish.

- It's a pollution filter for your nose.
- Okay, anyone else?
- I think he's right, actually.

okay anyone else I think he's right
actually I think this is for two bottles
of drinking you can redo fizz in them
okay refigerator
yeah this pump I have the refrigerator
and I bring you fizzy two bottles that
one
I think it's some of that because the
ribs on the thing I don't if the Nate
the nose thing would let's see it's
actually luring so stuffy nose breathing
apparatus you said for pollution and
stuff this is for when you're sleeping
it doesn't matter what it's for it's
what one point for me opens up your
nostrils oh so when you're sleeping at
night you get better breathing

Wish.

- Oh. "HelloDream".

that is work toy I'm gonna Chuck
my cock and oh god no yeah I'm gonna
check my yeah pointy cocking oh do you
want to guess what it is they've all
said obviously if the lights your missus
and the other bit is for stimulating
something inside and if that's a
prostate as your ass yeah vagina no you
know those things where you stick your
fingers to get one of those but for a
man and a lady I think there's a vagina
Anna can yeah but how about

- But "HelloDream" sounds so soft, and tender, and nice!
- Yeah. They do things like that, the Chinese pirates.
- They're like the Tenga Eggs, have you ever heard of those?
- No.
- They're like an egg, and you fuck it.
- So, like a normal egg.
- Is that a handle to clip it on your belt?
- Oh, that'd be great! "Hey lads, look what I just bought for you!"
- Fancy Japanese fanny simulator here!
- Maybe the top bit is for the lady, but I think that's unlikely. You wouldn't have a sex toy when you're having sex. That's pointless.
- I need answers!
- I think they're comprehensively answering.
- I'm going to say that the sexual equivalent of the finger binding thing, but for a man and a lady.
- I think those ear things inflate inside your bum.
- I don't want to...say there is...
- Oh, it's the size of an iPhone.
- It's a phone case! Oh...
- It's a fucking flask, guys! It's for putting hot liquids in.
- Ah. I could put my dick in that.
- Unfortunately, due to the very wide shape of it, and it looking very short and small...
- How small is that flask?
- You get one yog play in it, you're done.
- Don't put your yoghurt in that! It's not for hot yoghurt!
- I've got a hot lassi with my name on it.
- The dog.
- No points!

Wish.

- Is that a power button?
- Penis calibrator.
- That is...a lighter.
- Oh, God. So, it could be a musical sex toy, or it could be a vape device or something, that's also an MP3 player or something...?
- I would go for...home...chemical...tester.
- MP3 player.
- Oh, my God! It does look like a DNA sequencer or something if you look at the thing, doesn't it? Uhh...
- Settings...
- In and out settings. What?...And brightness. Hang on! Brightness, volume, in, and out! Sounds like the Agra Do! It's a vape...most probably a testing device.
- Is it a light that flashes in time with music?
- All really good answers; unfortunately, that is the sex toy.
- Oh!
- "Masturbating Cup Hands"...
- It is literally a sex toy with a built-in MP3 player.
- It's a pocket fanny. You can stick it to a hard surface if you want, you stick your dick in it...basically.
- I like how it says "Ultimate Piston" on the side.
- What really confused me...
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it heats up. You're going to stick your dick in something that comes from China and it heats up. Fine. Apparently, it's the same size that will bigger than a woman. Also, it's got a no-entry sign on it, when clearly the other picture shows you entering it! There's a lot about this advert I really don't understand.
- "Auto Suck Masturbator".
- I think you're asking for an injury from that thing.
- I wouldn't put mine in that.
- I did that in my Kitchen Gadget Testing. That's a hot dog cooker!
- Reminds me of that guy who...
- Oh, man.
- ...that guy who had sex with a Findus Crispy Pancake and he cooked his knob end.
- Some guy fucked a pasty from Greggs, and sued them 'cause it burned his dick.
- I'm going to guess the judge didn't rule in his favour.
- No, he won.
- What?
- No, he didn't.

- The winner will be getting a hand job from you later.
- With the "Wankerchief".
- "Wankerchief".

- So, welcome to Barshens, and this is called "Be Careful What You Wish For".
- Oh, Chris, can you do that again, please? You touched your mic.
- Did I?
- IT'S BEEN ON FOR THREE SECONDS!!!
- Bloody hell!

Wish.
