Is this where you want to sit? Okay.
No. It's fine. I can try and get comfortable. It's just... a lot of stones, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I am listening, it's just that woman over there looks like she's about to litter, and I just want to keep an eye on her... She put it in the bin. It's fine.
Do you want some? ...No? Okay. ...So are you not worried about like... skin damage? ...Cancer, yeah. I meant cancer. I didn't want to say it, but yeah, I meant cancer.
Why would you come and sit so close when there's so much space? ...Hi.
Am I going swimming? Um... I don't think so.
Algae, certain types of fish in there - they actually bite - and there's the obvious one: drowning.
And I just think I don't have the core strength to save either you or me if one of us did drown. ...But you can go swimming if you want, I don't mind.
