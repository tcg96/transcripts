Excuse me? Hi. What breed is your dog? ...He's a mix? Um, and what's he a mixture of? ...Right, I thought so. See? That's exactly what I said!
Hello. ...Well, he's not very friendly, is he? Is he a rescue? ...Yeah, I thought so. They do come with a lot of trauma.
Our dog, Tinkerbell, she's 130 months, yeah, which is a very difficult age. She was a rescue. Apparently she'd been living at Chester Zoo, and she'd been around the animals for so long, that she thought that she was one of the lions, yeah. So she's very intelligent.
Has he had any training yet? ...No. Are you thinking about classes? ...You are. ...I would think about it some more, because I actually trained Tinkerbell myself. I don't like the idea of somebody else training my dog when I'm in charge.
Shh. Shh. Hey. Yeah, see, you've got to assert your dominance. Hey!
And you should never look them directly in the eye, because it intimidates them. ...A bit like my husband here. ...Oh, it's a joke.
