It's the start of November and that's the third Christmas advert I've seen today. ...Is it festive, or is it just capitalism?
Is it festive for people who are homeless, or depressed? You know, what about people who have a narcissistic mother that they don't speak to? Yeah-- this is a very difficult time of year for some people.
I mean, I knew from four years old that Father Christmas isn't real. ...Nobody told me. No, I just... I just sort of figured it out myself. I've always had a gift for things like that, yeah. Well, I saw COVID coming a mile off.
I remember being a child and disliking Christmas. You know, we did the Nativity one year and I was supposed to play an angel, and at the very last minute, my role was given to another girl and I had to play a sheep. And... and to this day, you know, I don't know why they cast her, because she was a very ugly child.
If people say Merry Christmas to me, I'll say it back. But I... you know, I won't mean it, um... Also, I had a much better singing voice than she did. ...Uh, the girl who played the angel, yeah.
