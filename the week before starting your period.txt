I just feel like everyone is against me.
Why did you just look at me like that? ...Yeah. That smile. That nice smile that you just gave me. What does that mean?
So I've just gone on the NHS website, and it turns out I am more anxious than other people. ...No, I don't want to do anything about it.
It's just sad, isn't it? ...The animals! Yeah. Because... because they're so innocent...
My mum's just texted me asking what I'm doing. I'm sorry, but get a life. Sometimes she makes me feel so suffocated...
I just feel like everybody is always pestering me and asking me to do things for them. When do I ever ask anybody to do something for me?
Please, could you go and make me a cup of tea, and fill up my hot water bottle? And then when you bring them in, I don't want you to look at me and I don't want you to say anything. And I don't want you to breathe loudly. It will just be better for both of us.
