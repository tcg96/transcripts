Look, I don't want to jinx it, but I feel like I found the one. No, obviously we haven't met yet, but...
In a way, we have already met. You know, we had that really long meaningful phone call, when he rang me that one time at 2 o'clock in the morning when he was really drunk, and... this moment where he took his phone into the toilet, and like, I could hear him having a wee while he was talking to me. And it just shows that he must feel so comfortable around me to do that.
We did plan to meet up once, but he had to cancel because he was seeing his friends, and... You know, I'm not going to stop somebody from having a social life. And it's really funny because I then put "can I come as well?" ...Well, I was kidding!
He has two sisters, so he's used to being around women. He's not actually told me that he has sisters, I just looked it up, like I found it on Facebook. So now I have to pretend that I don't know, so I'll have to like be surprised when he tells me. But they seem like such a lovely family.
Oh my god, he just texted me. Okay, so he took... nine hours to respond. So how long should I leave it, like two hours? ...Should I set an alarm?
