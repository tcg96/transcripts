- Katie!
- No, please! Gah!
- Guys, time out. Time out. Katie, are you okay?
- Yeah. What? I love exercise. Do you guys need a break? I'm feeling good, but maybe you need a break?
- No, I'm good.
- What about you?
- I'm good.
- You're good?
- Yeah, fine.
- You're good too?
- I'm fine.
- Great. Same here. I'm just as fit as all of you.
- You're panting a lot, and we just started playing, like, three minutes ago.
- And when Mike tossed you the ball, you screamed "no, please".
- Did I? No. No, I'm fine. Let's get back into this.

- Katie!
- Shoe, Jesus!
- Time out. Katie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just needed to tie my shoes.
- Listen, Katie. If you need to take a little break, that's totally fine with us.
- Yeah.
- No, I'm so into this. Watch.
- What are we watching?
- What is this?
- Just stop for a little while.
- Man, I'm already feeling this light workout. I just need to work this out really quickly.
- You're getting sweat all over the ball.
- No, that's definitely doing it. Okay, I'm good to go. Cynthia.
- Give it to me!!!
- Oh, I missed it.

- ... Where's Katie?
- Yeah, where is Katie? Katie?
- Katie?
- Sorry, I just remembered it's my mom's birthday, and I had to give her a call because she goes to bed early.
- Okay, Katie, this is ridiculous, all right? If you want to take a break, we'll take a break, and if you want to keep going, we're just going to keep going. There's no more stopping, okay?
- I don't need a break, so that's what I want to do as well.
- How are you this sweaty?
- I'm fine playing more...but maybe they need the court?
- No.
- Hey, are you trying to get in the court? Do you have this reserved? We can leave. Hey, come on!
- Katie, I reserved the court this morning. Don't act like you weren't CCd on the e-mail.
- I'm just faking you all out!

- Hey. You know? We never get pictures anymore. We should take more pictures. Let me just set up my auto timer...
- You're not fooling anyone. You're clearly trying to take a break.
- Please, just take a break!
- No, I'm good to go! Toss me the rock!
- I don't know, Katie.
- Toss me the fucking rock!
- All right. Here.
- I did not say "whip me the rock".
- I didn't whip it to you!
- I said toss it to me!
- Trapp, you have to stop passing it to her. You're just making it worse.
- She's the only person on my team! What am I supposed to do?
- Katie, we're legitimately worried about your health. If you can't play basketball, that's fine! You don't have to do this to yourself.
- Come on, guys, I'm in shape too, okay? Watch.

- Oh!
- Holy shit.
- I'm fine! I'm fine!
- Okay. You know what, guys, you know what? I'm very tired and I need a break. Right? So why don't we all take five while I rest?
- Pussy.
- Well, this is two on two now. This makes more sense, anyway.
