CollegeHumor's all-nighter!

- Oh my God. I just realized, now that there's two of us, we can finally do a video that passes the Bechdel test.
- Oh my God, that's crazy!
- Yeah!
- Okay. What are the rules again, then?
- Okay. So, it has to have two women in it...
- Right. Did...done.
- They talk to each other...
- Yeah, doing it right now.
- ...about something other than a man.
- Oh my God, that's so easy. 
- Yeah!
- All right, let's do it! Okay. 
- Okay.

- ... Okay...what, no. ... You know, as soon as you said men, all I could think about was men. [FAIL] Uh.
- It's like when someone's like, "Don't...think about pandas".
- Right.
- So then, of course you think about...men.
- All the time. [FAIL]

- So that's why I hate rats.
- Yeah. Oh, I really like your shoes.

- Do you have any pets?
- No. Do you have any pets?
- No. ... Hey. ... Steve Urkel. [FAIL] Okay. I just said that to end the conversation.
- Oh my God, thank God, I had nothing to say.

- You know, Miley Cyrus actually has, like, a great voice.
- Yes, she does, and she gets no credit...
- None!
- ...for it.
- It's, like, so unfair, I think.
- Yeah.
- Miley? She's totally grown up.
- Oh my God, Evan, get out!
- You need to leave!
- Who's going to be here for a while?
- Go!
- Leave!
- So you want me to go? Is that...
- Oh my God, Evan!
- ...Is that a yes, or...?
- Yes! Why are you still in this room?
- I need it eventually!
- So entitled! You know, men are gross. [FAIL]
- Okay. I should have got it for criticizing men, so...you should re-evaluate that.

- Hit me! ... Oh, man! [FAIL]
- Dude! [FAIL]
- Will you just come on, guys? [FAIL]
- Oh, my God. [FAIL]
- Okay. First of all, God could be a woman...
- Thank you.
