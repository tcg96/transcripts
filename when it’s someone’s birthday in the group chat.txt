Aww, everyone is saying happy birthday to Julie in the group chat, because it's her birthday. That's nice. ...I don't think they did this for me.
I don't think I'm going to put "happy birthday" just yet, because then it'll look like I'm doing it because everyone else has done it, and that's classic sheep mentality.
Do you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, people definitely didn't do this in the group chat on my birthday. In fact, people were messaging me a couple of days later, being like "happy birthday for the other day!" or "happy late birthday!" which isn't a thing, um... and it's just something you don't forget.
I set reminders on my phone, for other people's birthdays. Yeah. Would you know how long that takes? Five seconds. ...Well, it's just the kind of person I am.
No, this hasn't upset me! If anything, it's just confused me... because I didn't think Julie was that well-liked.
If... If Julie's so great, why didn't she wish me a happy birthday? Because she didn't, and she never has. I... It's just always me who gets forgotten, isn't it? It's... it's ridiculous. Um... Anyway, I think I'm going to come off my phone for a little bit.
