Hi, everybody. This is Tuesday, and I'm back with another video, and welcome to day 13, and today I'm coming to talk to you about something that I just don't understand!
Okay, so what I don't get is, right? Whenever you come out to someone, you tell them you're gay, like, you know, you know, someone finds out you're gay...This maybe not be in every single case, but maybe like 95% of the time, when you tell someone you're gay, the first thing they think about is you having sex.
Especially with homophobic people, like, when you tell someone you're gay, and they're homophobic, the first thing they think about is you having anal sex, which is actually really stupid when you think about it, because not every single gay person likes anal sex. Ever heard of a top or a bottom?
'Cause everything is so fucking stupid, that, for people who don't like it, people who are, the, constantly saying, you know, "we hate gay" blah blah blah. If you don't like it, why think about it? Why are you thinking about two men having sex, if you don't like it?
Bitch needs to come out yourself. Just because you can't face the reality that you love it. Stop thinking about it. If you don't like it, stop thinking about it.
It's like when I see a straight couple, I don't think about those two having sex, you know, "oh, he goes down on her", like, seriously, why would I think about that? Because I don't like it.
Okay, so just before I go, I've got a little message to, any of, you know, homophobe out there, or anyone who, you know, who instantly thinks of, you know, two blokes together or two women together: if you don't like gay sex, don't have it!
Bitches need to be told.
