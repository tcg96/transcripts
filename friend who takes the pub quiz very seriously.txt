Okay. So, if you know the answer, instead of shouting it out, like last time, what I think we should do is: whisper it to the person next to you, and the whispers can travel clockwise, which is this way, until it reaches me, and then I will write it down.
I mean yeah, I just assumed I would be writing the answers down. Some of you do get quite distracted, and... I don't know, I've been told that my handwriting is very... neat, so...
Oh my god, oh my god, no, I know what this is, I know what this is, don't say it, don't say it. No I... I actually know what this is, I know what this is! ...Right, yeah. The Berlin Wall. Yeah. I was literally about to say that!
Guys, shh, shh, shh! Music round.
Oh my god, oh my god. Pass me the paper. Pass me the paper! Pass...! I love this song so much. Every single day!
I'm pretty sure that man keeps going to the toilet to look up the answers, so I think one of you lads should follow him in there and just like, record it on your phone so that we've got evidence. You know, so that they can be disqualified. ...No? Okay. ...I'm just going to go and get a drink...
Um, okay, so that man wasn't cheating. It's actually more of a personal issue why he has to keep going to the toilet, and also we've been asked to leave. Sorry guys.
