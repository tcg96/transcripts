- What were you thinking?
- I thought it'd be cute.
- Cute? Bitch, you're pushing 30.
- Technically, right now, I'm forever 21. ... You're right. Rompers are for toddlers and Beyoncé.
- You look fine as fuck. Hello, Beyoncé.
- More like Blue Ivy.
- Okay, sure, yeah, it's a little childish, but in, like, a sexy way...like pigtails.
- I'm pretty sure pigtails are just for kindergarteners and porn stars.
- Fashion is all about owning it. Do you know the most stylish thing you can wear?
- Please don't say crop tops.
- Crop tops?
- Confidence.
- Oh.
- You look like a snake that just ate.
- No problem, there's a draw string.
- It's like a belt, but bunchier.
- Look at your legs.
- In your 180-degree wedgie!
- Camel toe is the new under butt.
- Eww.
- It's definitely not.
- Look. When is the last time that you bought something that you were really excited about?
- Oh! I got this pair of jeans with an elastic waist...
- Exactly. You need a little fun in your closet.
- How are you supposed to pee in this monstrosity?
- Honestly, I feel like I could just do it all along the legs. ...Whoops, nope, whatever. I don't know...just go into the stall and get naked! It'll be fun! So free, so summer!
- Until someone barges in on you with your tits out scrolling through Instagram.
- Oh, my.
- Don't listen to her; you look dynamite.
- You don't look like dynamite; you look like a grenade.
- You look like a girl at Coachella.
- Oh. Actually, I do agree. Because the way the fabric hangs, it looks like you're passed out on the floor of a porta potty.
- It's casual! It's low-maintenance!
- So if you need someone to guard the bathroom door while you free the nipple just to piss.
- Fashion is about making a statement.
- In this case, that'd be "My boyfriend's going to hate this".
- Don't dress to impress a man.
- So I'll just dress to impress other women. There's nothing intimidating about that idea.
- Look. Rompers are awesome, okay? It's like wearing a skirt, but when you're on the subway, your pussy doesn't touch the seat!
- ...I did it! I overcame all the insecurity that goes into making a new fashion choice!

- Well, fuck.
- You can't return that.
- I know, I ripped the tag off...
- No. ...
