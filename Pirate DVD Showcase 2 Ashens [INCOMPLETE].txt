- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Stuart.
- Time for one of our regular features, the pirate DVDs!
- Yeah, we've been doing lots of these!
- Yes, our second one ever...and the last one was two years ago.
- Yeah, yeah.

- Let's begin with the starriest of all the wars...
- My favourite war in the stars.
- Star Wars Episode 4: The New Hope!
- Yeah!
- So, let's begin, shall we? The picture at the top of Vader appears to be from Return of the Jedi...
- Yeah, that's correct.
- The pictures over here are of E-Wing fighters, and apparently these were taken from a fan render, from a web site from like the '90s or something, they've fiddled around with a bit...
- Yeah, these aren't in any of the films. They're from the novels, the expanded universe stuff...
- We genuinely didn't recognise them and I had to ask on Twitter for people to tell us what they were, because they do not feature in any of the films, not even for a little bit. On the back, for "The New Hope", we've got another picture from Return of the Jedi, one from Star Wars Episode I...and one from The Empire Strikes Back!
- So all the Star Wars, except the one we are...reviewing. It's great!
- It really is. Also, "Sony PlayStation 2 Compatible". Hooray!
- Like all the best things are. Do we get special features like Concept of Star War?
- At last! I have been wondering about that. Yeah, "Special features: commentary with director"...not this film, probably. "Concept of Star War", and some other boring stuff. What is the disc like?
- They have cut off the incorrect title.
- Yes. It's now "The New Hop". It's a dance that Darth Vader has invented. "Has taken the galaxy by storm!"

- Time for one of the most popular crime fighters: the Man of the Bat. I think that's his name.
- Correct.
- Widescreen edition of Batman Begins, or Christopher Nolan's first attempt at The Dark Knight.
- It's my favourite Christopher Nolan Batman film.
- It's also my favourite!
- Oh, we should be friends!
- Never! Never! ...But, yeah, most people prefer the second one. As enjoyable as the Joker is, there's something about the first movie I like. Maybe a little too ninjay, but I like the way Gotham is portrayed in it, sort of comic-booky and Gothic, and that kind of thing. On the back, this is what you need to know about Batman Begins: "Although repetitive at times, it does provide a few hours of fun."
- Glowing review!
- Says Chris Wilson from Next Level Gaming.
- "As you play Batman, you will have to go through stealth-based levels in the vein of Splinter Cell. You will have to put fear into the hearts of criminals."
- Boom.
- "This game contains no bosses at all. It also contains a level set in Arkham Asylum. You will be able to drive the Batmobile in the game." Which this is not, because this is a movie.
- Yes. Good work, lads.
- What surprises me about this is that every detail of this is right, but then they went and copied a "review" of the Batman video game rather than the film.
- See, that does take some attention to detail, because normally everything is wrong, so it's nice to only see one major cock-up.
- Glaring error.
- Also, they've written DVD-9 all over it, which is an absolute sure sign that it's a DVD-5. Because it is. But it's a decent rip of the actual DVD.

- First, there was Terminator. Then, there was Terminator 2, and we try not to think of any of the other ones past that...but they do exist. Here's one of them. Schwarzenegger in Terminator 3: Rise of the...collectable... What would you call those, collectable statues?
- I think they're...busts?
- Yeah, that's the term.
- You wouldn't put one of those on top of your piano?
- Well, I'd do if I had a cyber piano.
- Or a piano, full stop.
- So I like how they've taken a picture of the collectable here, "T3" on it...and they've managed to reverse it there, so it says "ET"!
- Also, just flip it back a minute, because they've not actually written "of the", so it just says "Rise Machines".
- Oh, yeah. Terminator 3: Rise, Machines!
- Okay.
- Right. "The Machines Will Rise", because we told them to. Look at all these stretched screen shots.
- This one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's massive face.
- "I'll be...Oh, God".
- Also, can I point out that all the fonts are wrong? We've got some boring Arial, and this is not a credit font.
- That's why you can barely bloody read it.

- Time for some more Star Wars. Last time we had Episo pe II, now we've got Episode II! "Angriff der Klonkrieger", which I'm assuming is Attack of the Clones?
- You would have thought so, wouldn't you?
- I like the idea of different names actually. This one is called "The Hat That Wouldn't Quit".
- Star Wars Episode II: Jar Jar's Revenge!
- Oh, God. Never joke of Jar Jar. So basically, this has been printed by somebody in their house. And by somebody who'd run out of red ink, quite obviously.
- Look at the dodgy photoshopping there.
- Yeah, that's nasty. Properly nasty.
- Skywalker 2002 has taken credit for this design. You've not done very well.
- Yeah. I would have left off the credit if I'd made this. "Made by somebody else".
- Definitely not made by Skywalker 2002.
- Skywalker 2002 had nothing to do with this, honest. So the disc looks like a home print. It's a label stuck on, I believe.
- But he's got a Priss from Blade Runner-style strike going across his eyes. Just like in the movie!
- That's great.
- And Luke Skywalker has no mouth!
- It looks like a home-made DVD-R, and my god, it certainly is. I had great difficulty reading this. But this is a "cam", so to speak. Somebody sat in the cinema with a camcorder and recorded the whole thing. The audio is all right, it might be a tele-sync.
- Oh, that's great, so we can hear all that amazing dialogue.
- Oh. Don't ever joke about that. Actually, let's give you a screen grab to give you an idea of what this looks like. ... Yeah. Might as well have gotten somebody to explain it to you, really. You can roughly see moving shapes, and it looks blurry, and low res, and blurgh.
- ...So a glowing review, then.
- Yes. Basically, it's the best way to experience it, I would have said.

- Next up...a Blu...oh, that's exciting. A Blu-Ray! "Hi-def picture, hi-def sound". Not on this, because it's a DVD-9.
- Hey, at least it is a DVD-9.
- That's true, I suppose. So this is a film called The Prince, starring...Jason Patric, Bruce Willis, and John...I hate when they do that. I've not heard of this film.
- No, me neither. But Bruce Willis now does a lot of straight-to-DVD stuff where he shows up for like ten seconds, so I'm guessing it's one of those.
- It can't be that old, because it says "From the producers of Escape Plan", which is relatively recent. But the nice thing is: "10 in 1", because you literally get ten films on one DVD. You've got The Prince A and The Prince B...
- Um...
- The first half of the film and the second half of the film.
- Oh.
- Contraband, Sabotage, with Arnie, The Bag Man, Serbian Mort, or as we call it over here, The Raid, The Raid 2, B13, and D13U, which is the sequel, which is a bit confusing. So, how would you expect the quality of ten films stuck on one disc?
- Awesome.
- I just realised it's technically nine, isn't it?
- They're being a bit cheeky.
- A bit cheeky bordering on illegal. And yeah, the quality of them all are dreadful. The Prince is slightly higher quality, because, of course, it's in two halves. But the bit rate is super low on all of these. But what's nice is the smooth jazz playing in the menu. And if you want to see a shot from the film...yeah.
- That's not how I wanted to watch The Prince.
- At last, I've been waiting so long to watch "The Prince". After that, I shall watch that other popular John Cusack film, "The Bag Man".
- And after that, I'm just going to stare longingly at this lovely sepia picture...of John Cusack and Bruce Willis!
- I love you, guys!
- Oh, another one! Not a sepia one...but God! If you're a fan of these two and you want to pin some tin up your wall...

- Right. Time for some light refreshment for the children...it's Stuart Little 3! Call Of The Wild. "The next big thing in little adventure". And piracy! The film doesn't look that nice. It's all computer-animated and cel-shaded and looks cheap and crap. It looks like a cutscene from a late-era PlayStation 2 game, the whole film. Those are low-quality screen shots, it doesn't look quite that bad. "Pack your bogs and load up the cmping gear, time to answer Stuart Uttle 3: Call of the Wild! In this exciting animated adventure..." No, sorry, "onimated adventure"...
- "Adveture".
- Oh, my god. "In this exciting onimated adveture, the Littleos head into the wilderness when they take a camping trip faer from the city. There's just one thing they didn't pack for: the big bad beast that supposedly lives in the woods! While Stusrl..." Oh, that's not funny at all. "While Stusrl learns basic survival skills from a feisty skunk named Reeko"... That actually is his name, I looked that up. "Scaeredy cat Snowbell uses street-smart alley cat Monty for protection. Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild is fun that's as the great outdoors!" Blimey.
- We're going to start calling you Stuart Uttle.

- Finally, Catch Me If You Can.
- What an apt tagline.
- Special edition, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, "The True Story of a Real Fake". ...Can't argue with that! "This is a story that zings all the way through with originality, humour and pathos". I like the sound of it.
- Say the Urban Cinefile critics at Urban Cinefile.
- Good old Urban Cinefile.
- Can we say that this one says DVD-9...and it actually is!
- Yeah, that's possibly the only one! ...we've come across.
- "Credits: Frederick Knott."
- He invented all the credits. Blimey. After all that, I feel like watching Stuart Uttle, or possibly Stusrl Uttle.
