- Why don't you start by telling us where you were the night of the 27th?
- Look, I already told you. I was at home.
- So we actually have CCTV footage of you in the park that evening.
- Okay. I was at home, and then I went for a walk. Am I not allowed to go for a walk where I live?
- At 2 o'clock in the morning?
- I just... I had to get out. Clear my mind.
- Because... you killed her.
- What? No! I... I would never... hurt Lisa.
- Do you know anybody who would?
- ...
- Come on. Who are you trying to protect?
- Nobody. I just... Look, I've already told you everything I know.
- How did you get that bruise?
- ...I... I must have fallen over.
- Fallen over. I see. Why don't you start telling us the truth?
- The truth. ...The truth is that once upon a time, me and Lisa were like sisters. We did everything together. And then she started hanging around with some different people. Dangerous people. And she became a stranger to me. ...Look. I don't know who killed Lisa... but the person who wrote this might.
