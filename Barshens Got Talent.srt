00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
- Barry.
- Hi, Stuart.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,820
Do you think Barshens has any talent?

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,080
I don't know. Maybe we should do a video to find out.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,840
No.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
[theme music]

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,000
- Wow, what an amazing set of credits!
- [Stuart gasps]

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
We've blown the budget out of the water!

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,160
But don't...not really...it doesn't stop there, does it? Oh, no.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,920
- We haven't actually blown the budget out of the water. Thank God for that.
- No, no. No. Phew.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,360
Uh, we have sourced from the crew, the Barshens crew, some of the best talent around.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,440
- Mmm.
- And it's not about us, it's about them.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,840
- It's all about them...
- Yeah.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,940
- ...and how rude we can be to them after they've bared their soul to us.
- Mmm-hmm.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,560
You're going to be the rude one, I'll be the nice one, or do you...

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,920
I think we should just, uh, be honest, by which I mean we'll both be rude.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,900
- [Paul laughs off-screen]
- Yeah? And there are no prizes.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,320
Yeah, no prizes, except...

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,440
- the adulation of the masses...
- Hmm.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,080
- A worship.
- which is in itself...

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,080
worthless.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,940
- [Stuart] Hello.
- [Ryan] Hello.
- [Barry] Hello.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,040
{\an8}Hello, my name is Ryan, I'm from Norwich...

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,320
{\an8}[Stuart] We know, mate, you've worked here for like years.

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,980
Who have you come here today with, Ryan?

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,320
- Stuart and Riyad on...on the train.
- [Paul laughs off-screen]
- [Barry] Oh, yeah.
- [Stuart] Yeah.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
- [Barry] What else didn't we ask?
- [Stuart] Umm...yeah...

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,600
[Stuart] Do you have a sob story?

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,520
Any sob story we can play on and then...edit up.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,720
Four days before my eighth birthday, my pet hamster, Thomas, died.

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,580
My mum told me in the bath, and I cried, and said he was selfish.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,380
- Ah.
- [Stuart laughs] He was!

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,080
- It's a selfish fucking hamster.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,400
[Barry] Well, I'm sure he'd be proud of you today, Ryan.

34
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,760
- He's looking down on you.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,660
He's dead.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,560
All right. Do your thing, then. [clears throat]

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,980
What...what is the nature of your act?

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Um, so, I'm...Have you seen the film Pitch Perfect?

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,000
- [Ryan] Either of you.
- [both] No.

40
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,660
[puts chair down] I'm actually really fucking nervous.

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,460
- [Stuart] I'm not surprised. That's a glass, isn't it?
- [Barry] Just...just take your time, Ryan.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,080
Just take as long as you need.

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,620
- [Stuart] I'm intrigued as to where this is going.
- [Barry] Might as well...

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,040
- It might take me a little...
- [Barry] Yeah, take your time. Take your time.

45
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,600
Okay.

46
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,420
[Ryan makes a beat with his hands and the glass]

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,860
[singing] I got my ticket for the long way 'round

48
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,340
[emotional music starts] Two bottle of whiskey for the way

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,780
and I sure would like some sweet company

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,600
and I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,300
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

52
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,280
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,020
You're gonna miss me by my hair

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,820
You're gonna miss me everywhere

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,800
[Barry] Whoo!

57
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,100
- [Applause]
- [Paul] That was very good!
- [Barry] Good job!

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,100
- Yeah. I'm gone. I'm gone. Sorry.
- Barry's teared up.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
- Uh, sorry.
- Barry actually has teared up.
- Yeah, uh...

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,820
[Barry] Your hamster is looking down on you, Ryan. That was...[sniffles]

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,440
[Stuart] Yeah.

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,660
That was really good. Yeah. Be proud. Sorry.

63
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,900
[emotional music stops] I thought it was shit. Fuck off.

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,240
[Paul laughs off-screen, Barry giggles]

65
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,800
[silence]

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,900
Off!

67
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,080
[silence]

68
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,260
[Paul] Aww. Round of applause, though.
[Applause]

69
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,600
[Barry] It was a "yes" for me.

70
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,720
But the head judge took the "no".

71
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,460
- [Barry] You're the head judge.
- [Ryan] Fuck...you.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,800
{\an8}[out of breath] Thank you.

73
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,700
{\an8}Hello.

74
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
{\an8}- [Stuart clears throat] Hello, Paul.
- [Barry] Hello.

75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,620
{\an8}- [Paul] Hello.
- [Barry] What's your name, Paul?

76
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,560
My name's Paul. I'm from Liverpool and, uh...

77
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,720
I like the colour red...

78
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,280
and...my favourite singers are Sonia and Cilla Black.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
- [Stuart snickers] Wow. If only they dated.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,740
- [Stuart] Umm, what's your sob story, Paul?
- [Paul exhales]

81
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,040
I exist.

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,220
- [Stuart] Ooh. That...you got me right there.
- Yeah?

83
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,600
- [Paul] My very existence...
- Right on the microphone.
- [Paul] ...is painful.

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,020
- [Paul] Uh...but...uh...
- [quietly] It's all right, Barry. It's all right.
- Okay, sorry.

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,520
- [Barry] Take as much time as you need.
- [Stuart] Yes, as long as it's not more than five minutes.

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,180
[Paul] Well, before we go any further, I need to give you something.

87
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,020
- [Barry] Mate...
- So, I've got this...
- [Barry] Okay.

88
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,820
...right? And I need you to put this in your top pocket, where it's safe, right?

89
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,180
So, there you go, and I'm not going to be able to touch that the whole time, okay?

90
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,480
- [Barry] Okay.
- [Paul] All right?

91
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,100
- So, I'll begin, [sniffles] okay? [sniffles]
- [Stuart clears throat]

92
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,780
I'm not...sorry, I just want to...

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,500
I just want to...Before we get going, I've got a little bit of hay fever, so let me just, uh...

94
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,600
have some of this, and then I'll just, uh...

95
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,640
It's gone. So, that's my first trick.

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,100
[in awe] Aww! What?

97
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,740
- [Barry laughs]
- All right. So...my next trick...

98
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,560
uh, involves these three balls...

99
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,120
and these three cups, right?

100
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,060
Here we go. I'm going to take one little ball, right? This, I'm going to put on top of this little cup here,

101
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,740
and then I'm going to do that, and...

102
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,700
The magic words are "Piffity Puff Puff". [laughs] Right?

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,240
- I thought it might be.
- So, after one, two, three, say "Piffity Puff Puff" with me.

104
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,460
- One, two, three...
- [all three] Piffity Puff Puff!

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,780
And look. Oh, ooh, no, there we go.

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,700
- [Barry wheezes]
- [Paul] There we go.

107
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,920
There's the first ball.

108
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,040
And then we're going to put this on here like that... [laughs]

109
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,540
Why is everything I do shit?

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,640
- All right. One, two, three...
- [all three] Piffity Puff Puff!

111
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,620
- And look. There we go.
- [Stuart gasps]
- We've got two balls now.

112
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,180
It's getting better and hotter, isn't it?

113
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,800
- Right.
- [Stuart, quietly] He likes balls.

114
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,160
And then, the final...the final ball goes onto the cup like that,

115
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,320
I give the old magic words. One, two, three,

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,580
[all three] Piffity Puff Puff.

117
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,060
And look! Oh, it's three balls! One, two, three!

118
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,880
It's magic!

119
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,820
Right. [sniffles] Now, ...

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,940
- [Paul] ...finally...
- [quietly] Ooh, there's more. There's more.

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,460
...for my last magic trick, I'm going to get three ob--objects chosen at random that I picked ages ago.

122
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,200
So, I...have got this, and this is for Barry, okay?

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,760
- [Barry] Okay.
- So, I've got three objects.

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
All I want, Barry, from you, right now, is to pick any two of these objects out. Which do you fancy?

125
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,580
The crown...

126
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,060
and the water.

127
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,300
Right, cool.

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,960
Right. Now...pick me one of these.

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,820
- The water.
- You want the water.

130
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
- Yeah.
- Can you look in your top pocket then, please?

131
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,900
And tell me what it says written on that pocket piece of paper.

132
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,740
[Barry giggles]

133
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,120
- Oh, this is...do I need to show it to the camera? I think...
- [Paul, quietly] Yeah.

134
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,260
[in awe] Aww!

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,740
- [Paul] It says "bottle of water", ladies and gentlemen!
- [Stuart gasps]

136
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,180
[Paul] I am magic. That's been my act.

137
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,440
I wish I had a proper girlfriend.

138
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,220
Well done! That was, uh...
[Applause]

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,060
Yeah.

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,460
[Paul] I am magic.

141
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,000
Are you classically trained, Paul?

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,580
I am, but not in magic.

143
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,440
[Barry laughs] I was very impressed by that.

144
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,700
- [Paul] Yeah, uh, were you impressed by that?
- Does that blow your mind, you know, when he did that?

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,980
I thought that was absolutely pathetic. You made a joke of yourself. Get off the stage.

146
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,880
- [Barry laughs]
- Yay, I did well! I did really well!

147
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,760
Bye!

148
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,960
[Applause]

149
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,920
{\an8}- [Stuart] Hello, Chris.
- [Barry] Hello, Chris.
- [Chris] All right.

150
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,940
{\an8}- [Barry laughs]
- Where are you from, Chris?

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,960
{\an8}My name's Festival Twat, I'm 39, and I'm from the Wirral.

152
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,440
- Amazing.
- Wow. What are...what are those things dangling? They look like big earrings.

153
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,940
These are...these are fire poi, so, basically, you have to imagine that these are sort of a...

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
a roaring inferno and we're currently...

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,540
burning YouTube Space down.

156
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,920
- Okay.
- Okay. I'm getting on board with that. Yeah.
- Yeah.

157
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,640
When do we do that?

158
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,420
It's...it's in your mind, man, so you've just got to...

159
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,660
[Barry] Okay. [laughs]

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,220
- ...go with it, ...
- [Barry] That's good. Yeah, yeah.
- ...go with it...

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Let it burn.

162
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,460
- Okay, yeah.
- Uh, what's your sob story?

163
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,460
My cat's very sick.

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,300
- That sounds pretty...
- Yeah.
- ...pet related.

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
- Are you hoping that the...the prize will help...?
- Yeah.

166
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,540
- The prize were stronger, though, to be fair, the pet was dead, and not...
- Oh...

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,900
Uh, I mean, it can be dead, if that helps.

168
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,020
- Umm...
- [Chris] Would that help? I can do it now.
- When did you last check it was alive?

169
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,100
[Chris] I can do it now, it's...

170
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,180
- Umm...
- I've got it in a box outside, it's no problem.

171
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,900
[Stuart] Do it afterwards, and then we'll say we did it before.

172
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,640
- All right. With a brick, is that all right? I mean...
- I don't care how.

173
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,500
- [Stuart] Right...
- Awesome!
- [Stuart] So, what is your act?

174
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Well, it's fire poi. I might start fires myself, but only in my mind, so that's okay.

175
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,200
- [Stuart] Do your thing.
- This is basically all I can do, because I haven't done it for about ten years.

176
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,760
[ominous music starts]
I'm going to attempt a trick which will most likely result in me twatting myself in the face.

177
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
- [Chris] ...For your entertainment.
- Okay.

178
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,280
Yeah, that...that's a strong proposition.

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Uh, this is the 5-beat weave...

180
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,980
...and I used to be really good at it, and now I'm really shit at it, ...

181
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,380
...but if you can imagine the flames, it will add a sense of peril, and I believe that will help...

182
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,620
...me walk off with that prize and possibly a living cat.

183
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,040
I mean, to be fair, I could have just imagined a trick and not had anybody on.

184
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,300
- [Barry] Oh.
- [Stuart] Whoa. Whoa. Watch the mic.

185
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,700
- There we go. There's the windmill.
- [Barry] Ah.

186
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
[Applause]
[Paul] Whoo!

187
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
- And now, we're all on fire.
- [Stuart] Ooh.
- [Barry] Ah.

188
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,120
[Barry] Wow. Can you put the fire out now, or...?

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,260
- No, that's it. We're fucked. We're burned.
- [Barry] Okay. [giggles]

190
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,220
Umm...ah, that was very impressive.

191
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,260
[ominous music stops]
Ah, I thought it was dated, worthless, and get off.

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
{\an8}[Stuart] Eli Rolls!

193
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,740
{\an8}- [Stuart] He's blown...he's blown his load early.
- [Barry] Yeah, Mr Man of Silver, Eli.

194
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Hi!

195
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,520
- [Stuart] Hello.
- [Barry] Hello.

196
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,180
[Stuart] Oh, good, he's got the energy going. This is going to be bad.

197
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,820
[Barry] Nice shirt.

198
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,920
- So, uh...where are you from, Eli?
- [Eli laughs]

199
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,760
Sorry, I'm...just thinking about how my act's going to be...rocking!

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,940
- Uh...
- [Barry and Paul laugh]

201
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,340
Where am I from? From London.

202
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
- And what's your sob story, Eli?
- [Eli] I have...

203
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,280
...blotchy upper arms.

204
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,740
- [Eli] ...maybe.
- A bit weaker, I feel, that one.
- [Eli] Well, no, no.

205
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,900
I might have to cut gluten out, and it could help.

206
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,320
[Barry] Oh, okay.

207
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Probably the biggest tearjerker story we've had today, to be honest.

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,520
- They're well blotchy, man.
- [Barry, disappointed] Yeah.

209
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,600
[Paul laughs off-screen]

210
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,940
- What's your act? 
- What is your act, mate? Yeah.

211
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,500
Now...I have...

212
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,580
[coughs] ...an interpretive dance...

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,460
...with a little bit of a dialogue, a little drama...

214
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,300
...mixed with dance. Uh...

215
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,420
Could this be described as physical poetry?

216
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,720
[Eli] That's exactly what it is.

217
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,080
It's so nice to meet a judge who actually knows about, you know, the, uh...the definition of art forms.

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,220
So...[clears throat]

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,840
[opens jar] This is Keith...
[Paul laughs]

220
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
[sniffs] Ooh.

221
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,400
- Uh...
- [Barry] What is Keith?

222
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,520
He...he is a mummified mole.

223
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,680
- Yes, he really is, isn't he?
- Oh, my God! [laughs]

224
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,440
- [Stuart] Yeah!
- [Barry] Is it actually a mole?

225
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,300
- Yeah.
- [Stuart] It was at one stage, yeah.

226
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,100
- [Stuart] That's a very dead mole.
- [Barry] Oh, wow!

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,060
Was it...was that found in the crawl space of a building? Or, uh...?

228
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,140
I'm not sure. It was given to me...

229
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,140
...by, uh...

230
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,100
...Ryan's parents, so...

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,580
[Paul howls with laughter]

232
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,380
And I will...

233
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,500
...symbolically birth...

234
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,920
[Paul laughs]

235
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,700
- ...Keith...
- [Stuart] Okay, yeah.

236
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,580
...and then he will have a dialogue...

237
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,280
[Paul laughs]

238
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,780
...with this artificial cabbage flavour instant vermicelli noodle.

239
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,080
- Why artificial cabbage? Cabbage isn't hard to get, is it?
- [Barry laughs]

240
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,300
- [Eli] Yeah.
- There's something wrong with that, yeah.

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,120
Well, it's from a province in China where they had a...

242
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,180
...cabbage drought. [laughs] Sorry.

243
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,200
- [Barry laughs]
- Ah...that province.
- Yeah.

244
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,520
- Okay?
- [Barry] Yeah, whenever you're ready. Take your time.
- All right. Thanks.

245
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,960
Just let us know when you're ready.

246
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,340
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Are you ready? [laughs] Yeah?

247
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,860
[dramatic music starts]
[Eli makes pain sounds to simulate childbirth]

248
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,180
Keith...

249
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,440
Keith...!

250
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,880
I've borned you!

251
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,620
Now Keith is walking along!

252
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
[Eli and other people laugh]

253
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,840
What's that?

254
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
Keith...Keith, what's that?

255
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,320
What's that?!?

256
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,400
He says it's a noodle.

257
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,940
[laughter continues]

258
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,000
He says it's a noodle!

259
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,640
Shall we go over there? Yes.

260
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,700
I've borned you.

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,660
[sniffs]

262
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,320
Smells artificial. Why don't you ask it what it is, Keith?

263
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,060
Okay.

264
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,580
Mr Noodle?

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,660
Yes?

266
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,240
[Barry giggles]

267
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,140
What flavour are you?

268
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
Artificial noodle,

269
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,500
and cabbage and fish.

270
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,060
I hate fish.

271
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,160
That makes me angry.

272
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,640
[Eli as Keith growls]
[dramatic music becomes more intense]

273
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,260
[shouting] Angry Keith!

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,420
What happens to angry Keith? He shows his true face!

275
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,340
The other side of Keith: the witch side!

276
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,520
[Barry giggles]

277
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,940
The witch mouth of Keith's anus!

278
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,720
ARGH!!!

279
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,640
He strangled his maker! Argh!

280
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,660
[making choking sounds]

281
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,140
[Applause] [Paul] Oh, amazing. [dramatic music stops]

282
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,580
[Barry cackles]

283
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,220
[Eli] Thanks.

284
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,520
[various people laugh]

285
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,780
[laughter quiets down]

286
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,640
- [Stuart] Well, what did you think, Barry?
- One of the quietest performances of the day.

287
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,200
- Cheers, understated.
- Yeah.
- [Eli, quickly] So, am I through to the next round?

288
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
[Barry sighs] Umm...

289
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
My dad says I'm...I'm the best.

290
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,180
- Yeah.
- [Eli] I'm the best.

291
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,640
He says I'm the best.

292
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,420
When I came out of my mum, he said I'm the best.

293
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,440
- He said I--I'm going to be the..."you're going to be the best".
- Well...

294
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,020
The best dead mole wrangler ever.

295
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,960
I mean...in a dead mole category, you're probably winning it today.

296
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,640
- [Stuart] Yeah.
- [Barry] We've got a winner.

297
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,460
- I'm through to the next round! Dad!
- [Stuart] No. No, you are not. Back.

298
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,400
- [Stuart] Yeah, I mean...
- [Barry] So we can't...

299
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,880
Uh...it started strongly, I'll give you that, ...

300
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,800
- [Stuart] ...but then, the tonal shift was too great.
- [Barry] Hmm.

301
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,540
Uh...the witch anus...

302
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,060
the witch mouth anus...was just too much of a combination, I feel.

303
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,780
- [Barry] Hmm.
- [Stuart] Uh, overall...
- [Barry] That's the first time we've had a witch anus act.

304
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,680
...it's the worst thing I've ever seen, and I saw...

305
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,360
the Keith Lemon film at the cinema.

306
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
[Paul] Oof.

307
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,060
- Maybe come back next year.
- No, don't.
- Okay. [Paul laughs off-screen]

308
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
- But we're quite interested in seeing the mole again.
- All right.

309
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,860
- I'm changing, sir.
- [Stuart] Yeah, that's fine. All right. [Ryan laughs off-screen]

310
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,100
We'll get, uh...Ant & Dec to stick you on the mole list. Right.

311
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,700
And don't forget, if you'd like to apply for Barshens' Got Talent next year...

312
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,860
Yeah, don't bother!

313
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
'Cause, uh...there ain't going to be one.

314
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,920
Bye!

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
[theme music]

316
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
[silence]

317
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,020
What are you doing? [laughs]

318
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,520
Oh, all right, okay. Reacting to a...

319
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,640
Yes. Thank you, Barry. [both laugh]

320
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,720
