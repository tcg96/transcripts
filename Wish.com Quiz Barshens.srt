00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,940
[Chris] Welcome to Barshens, and this is a quiz called "Be Careful What You Wish For"!

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,140
Shall we talk about what...what you guys wish for, or shall we just crack on?

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,760
Umm...you could do.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,780
- What...?
- It depends if you think the format needs a bit of extra padding at the start.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,660
- It might do, to be fair. 
- Mmm.
- Okay, okay.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,280
- What do you wish for?
- I wish for...

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,840
...peace on Earth...

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,380
- Sounds...
- ...and goodwill to voles.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,620
Hmm. What about you?

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,120
I wish to go on the Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,220
[male voice] Barshens.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,420
[Chris] Are you guys familiar with the concept of Wish?

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,060
- Oh, Wish.com!
- [Ryan] None.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,340
[Barry] Ah!
[Stuart singing] They sell you tat for cheap!

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,720
[Chris] Anything you could imagine, and I mean...

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,860
[Chris] ...anything... 
[Barry] Okay.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
[Chris] ...exists on Wish. 
[Stuart] Eli's...beans? 
[Eli] My beans exist in China.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,680
[Chris] What we're going to have is a bunch of things that I've found on the Wish website, and the idea is, you have to...

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,460
...guess what its purpose is. Simple as that.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,720
And also, you have your...Speed Knob card...

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,180
- [Stuart] Oh.
- If you could pass these out...

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,320
[Ryan] Why has mine got pubes, and the others' haven't?

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,180
[Eli] You've got a pointy pee-pee.
[Stuart] Problematic.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,960
And...there's something going on with the testicles there, I don't like, as well.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
[Chris] One of the items from Wish may or may not be a sex toy...

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,640
- [Ryan gasps]
- If you think before your...

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,600
Before you guess that that's the sex toy...

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,920
play your Speed Knob card, and that's a chance for you to get an extra bonus point.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,680
[Chris] Shall we do the quiz?
[Stuart] Please.

30
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,700
[man whispering sensually] Wish.

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,500
[Chris] Fucking hell!
[Stuart] Well, this is comfortable.
[Eli] Squeezy. [Stuart grunts]
[Ryan] Hang on.

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,140
[Chris] This is...uh, six examples of the same item.
[Stuart] Yeah.

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,980
[Stuart] I think both me and Barry know what this is.
[Barry] Yeah.

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,480
You put that on a saucepan...

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,760
...on the lip of it, and it lets some steam go out, put the...lets the lid rest on it.

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,160
Why would you...? Well, just take the fucking lid off!

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,200
- [Stuart] Yeah...
- You can have it so it's just hanging, it just gives it a little bit of support.

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,260
[Stuart] It's a novelty gift thing, for people who like cooking, you see?

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
- You like what? Letting a bit of steam, but not all the steam off.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,520
[Chris] It's not what they're advertising it for, because, umm...

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
This sort of weird sex party...

42
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,100
...of little tiny men was basically another clue.

43
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,700
[Barry] Right.

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,240
- But your answer is that's their primary purpose, so now...
- Yeah. Like...like that, yeah?

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,120
Basically, I've fucked it already, haven't I?

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
[Paul, off-screen] Welcome to the fold. You've fucked everything.
[Chris laughs]

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,240
[Stuart] Welcome to Barshens! You obviously haven't been listening when you've been recording the sound!

48
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,180
[Barry] Should I play my sex card? I'm sorry, I'm confused.

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,500
- There's a twist.
- Does anybody want to have a guess of another purpose that these could be used for,

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,220
which is what it's primarily being sold as, on Wish?

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,480
[Ryan] Uhh...coat hanger.

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
[Barry] Human Centipede...

53
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,120
[Barry] Human Centipede...replica.

54
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,860
[Chris] It was primarily...
[Eli] Chopstick holder!
[Chris] ...on Wish being sold as a chopstick holder,

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,760
[Chris] ...but, since I fucked it...
[Stuart] Oh!

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
But it doesn't really work as a chopstick holder! What a bizarre thing!
[Chris chuckles]

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,140
- Welcome to Wish!
- [Stuart] Yeah.

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,760
- Points all rounds!
- [everyone cheers] Yay!

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
[Barry] Chopsticks are sexy.
[Ryan] Right.

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,160
[Stuart] Okay.
[Eli] Next one.
[Chris] Next one...

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,200
[man whispering] Wish.

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,300
[Chris] This is just a oner...it's not very difficult. What do you think that is?

63
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,800
[Ryan] I think you put...your fingers and thumbs in it, and you...

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,820
[Stuart] Yeah, as like an exerciser.
[Ryan] ...stretch it. Yeah.

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,120
[Eli] Finger exerciser.
[Ryan] I think so.

66
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,600
So, for people who are going to go and present children's programs, with glove puppets.

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,300
[Eli] Is it fake chewing gum?

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,440
[Ryan snickers]

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,060
How? Could you talk us through the process of it?

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,740
You put it in your mouth, you chew it, spit it out when you're done, give it a rinse.

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,160
- What's the purpose of the hole?
- [Barry mumbles]

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,680
The hole is, you can stick your tongue through it.

73
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,000
- Yeah.
- It's a tongue trainer.

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,060
[Barry] I reckon you carry beer bottles with it.
[Eli] Yeah, beer bottles.

75
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,940
[Eli] You stick a bunch of beer bottles through it, and then you can carry a bunch...

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,440
Oh, no, 'cause it...there's no bit to hold it as a handle by.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,900
[Ryan] No...I think.

78
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,480
[Paul, off-screen] I love the fact that you've lost all will to live, and it's only, what? Two questions? [Chris and Ryan laugh]

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,660
[Stuart] No, fifty-eight!
[Paul] You really excelled!

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,480
[Chris] That is...[clicks laptop touchpad] two points for Ryan and Stuart.

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,840
[Chris] And disturbingly...
[Barry] "Lover-Beauty Best"...
[Stuart] Oh.

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,700
[Chris] It's a bit sexy, but it's not really a sex toy.
[Paul] No.

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
[man whispering] Wish.

84
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,420
[Eli] It's a rubber chicken...

85
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,700
- ...and it makes a squeaky noise, and it's for a dog.
- [Barry] Dog toy, yeah.

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,380
[Stuart] I think it is, indeed, obviously a fake chicken, you can't deny that bit, but I think it's an electronic one.

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,540
I think you press the button and it makes chicken noises or squeaks electronically.

88
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,900
- There's...a thing around its neck, so you can take the head off.
- [Barry] Yeah.

89
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,000
[Ryan] I was going to say it's like for seasoning...seasoning a chicken and you put some stuff in there, maybe put it...

90
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,620
Ryan's got two points!

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
[Eli] For what?
[Stuart] Hey!

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
[Ryan, incredulous]Â Fuck off!

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,360
[Barry] Hey!
[Stuart] Oh, my God!
[Chris] You didn't need the second picture.
[Eli] What is it? A herb...?

94
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,800
[Chris] It's actually called...the "Crock Coq".

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
The Crock Coq! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

96
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,080
[Eli] What? You stick it in, you stick the herbs in, and then you can take the herbs out and it might save...?
[Ryan] That's great!
[Barry] Yeah, to add the flavour in. Yeah.

97
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,720
[everyone else] Yeah.
[Eli] Imbue their flavour into your dish.

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,100
[man whispering] Wish.

99
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,020
[Barry] Oh! [Stuart] Oh.

100
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,780
[Barry] That, is a...
[Eli] I know what that is.

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,400
- I know what that is.
- [Chris] Do you want to hold...

102
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,280
- I know what that is.
- [Barry] Is that...? Oh, uh...

103
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,640
Yeah, I'm going to chuck this in.

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,780
[Stuart, shocked] Oh, no! Oh, no! It's not, is it?
[Chris] Interesting!
[Ryan gasps]

105
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,220
[Chris] Do you want to walk us through that?
[Barry] I think that's a "wankerchief".

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,280
Oh, my God.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,260
- I think that's a Wankerchief...
- It could be.
- [Stuart] No, 'cause, uh...

108
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,240
where somebody puts their stem around it, ...

109
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,680
...and then...and they release their pollen...
[Paul laughs off-screen]

110
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,500
...after agitating the stem,

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,540
[Stuart] Yeah.
[Barry] ...and then, the pollen is collected in...the handkerchief, the Wankerchief.

112
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,860
[Stuart] No. I'm not agreeing with this.

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,020
[Eli] That is...
[Chris coughs]
[Eli] That is for solo...

114
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,180
hair and face shaving.

115
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,500
And it collects the hairs.

116
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,640
- [Chris] I mean, that's quite big for a wank. 
- You stick your head through there, and it collects the hairs.
- Yeah, that's exactly...

117
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,720
I did wonder at first if it was some sort of evil sex swing, but I noticed those small suction cups...

118
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,320
would not hold the weight of a human.

119
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,200
[Ryan] So, I th--I think this goes on the mirror,

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,780
[Stuart] Yeah.
[Ryan] ...and your barber, or yourself, cuts your hair, and it all falls...

121
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,560
[Barry] I think you're right!

122
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,120
[Ryan] ...into the...
[everyone laughs]
[Eli] You cannot take...You can't take your...that!

123
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,540
[laughter]

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,580
[Eli] Two points each?
[Chris] One point for everyone, except Barry, who's disgusting.

125
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,000
[Barry] Oh, no.
[Chris] It is, in fact...a shaving...
[Eli] I was the first to say that.

126
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,560
[Barry] The Wankerchief is a good invention, though.
[Paul, off-screen] It is!
[Barry] Yeah.

127
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
[Eli] What's the Wankerchief?

128
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,760
[Chris] Like that, but you put your dick through it.
[Barry] Well, we just invented it, didn't we?

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,460
- You put that around your "schtem"...
- [Chris laughs] Your "schtem".

130
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,960
And then you put your suckers on the wall, so you've got a good surface area, and then...

131
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,340
[Ryan] Barry. Your...your agent right now is just...
[Barry laughs]

132
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
[man whispering] Wish.

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,420
[Stuart] Oh. [Ryan] They look like...p--punctured testicles.

134
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,780
[Eli] Ear warmers.
[Chris] This is, again...it's for one point, and there's only one picture for this.

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
[Eli] Kidney warmers.
[Stuart] Umm...
[Ryan] Hmm.

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,160
[Stuart] They could be...um...

137
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,860
Giant golden beans.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Kind of look almost like a prosthetic, you sort of put on, then put make-up over, but I don't think so.

139
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,900
[Stuart] They could be, like, pads you put in your shoes, if your shoes are uncomfortable.
[Eli] Yes.

140
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,620
[Eli] They look like that sort of thing, don't they?
[Stuart] Under the...the ball of the foot.

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Would they be that small, though?

142
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,140
- Oh, yeah, they're tiny!
- [Barry] Like a heel protector.
- For people with really small feet. Yes.

143
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
[Eli] Eyebrows.

144
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Yeah...?

145
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,260
Flattened banana.

146
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,900
[Stuart] Flattened bananas, that's what they are.

147
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,760
[Stuart] Like...designer bananas.
[Eli] Golden flattened banana flakes.

148
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,680
Answers?

149
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,320
Flattened banana cake!!!

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Stu?

151
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,280
[Stuart] Umm...I think they are s--for protecting, like, part of your hand...?

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,400
[Ryan] These are ear protectors for when you go swimming.

153
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,360
[Barry] Is that the right answer?
[Chris] They're all...they're all lovely answers, and they're actually all a lot more sensible than reality, which is...

154
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
[Barry] Ah!
[Stuart] Oh.

155
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,360
[Barry] I think...
[Eli] And they're for, like, night cream.
[Chris] Yeah.

156
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,680
You put them onto your eyes and they make you look intensely startled, and...

157
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,860
[Barry] A bit like a superhero.
[Eli] No, it's for...to stop the bags developing.

158
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
[Stuart] Oh. That probably does nothing.

159
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,400
[Chris] No, they do absolutely nothing.

160
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,700
[man whispering] Wish.

161
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,060
[Stuart] I know exactly what this is, because I have owned two.

162
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,960
It has two functions.
[Stuart gasps]

163
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,000
[Barry] Wine stopper...
[Stuart] Yeah, it is a wine stopper, it's what it's sold as, and it's called Happy Man.

164
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,700
'Cause I used to get sent them to the P.O. box.

165
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,855
- It will do fizzy, and it will also do wine.
- A fizz stopper and a wine keeper.

166
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,000
[Chris] Uh...There's your second picture. It's not lovely...yes.
[Stuart] Nice. Nice.

167
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,680
[Ryan] Yeah.
[Chris] You quite like the...the twin ring detail?

168
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,620
[Eli] Oh, is it his penis that...extends into the bottle?
[Ryan, Stuart, and Chris] Yeah.

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,800
[Eli] Oh. How brilliant.

170
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,900
[Chris] Points all rounds!

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
[Paul, off-screen] How many?
[Barry] Oh, it's a bottle opener!
[Chris] Two!

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,260
[Ryan] His penis is very high up!
[Stuart] That's a different one! That's...that's a separate item.

173
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
[Barry] That's a bottle opener. I've never seen that before.

174
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,780
[Chris] I...I would assume you get...
[Eli] It's a bottle opener and a stopper.
[Chris] ...two for your money.

175
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,900
[man whispering] Wish.

176
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,540
[Eli] It's a pollution...

177
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,840
[Eli] It's a pollution...filter for your nose.

178
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
[Chris] Okay, anyone else?

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
[Stuart] I think he's right, actually.

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,920
[Chris] Two pollution filters?
[Ryan] I think this is for two bottles to drink and you can re-do fizz in them.

181
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,680
[Barry] Ooh. [sighs]
[Chris] Okay.
[Eli] "Refizzinator".

182
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,080
[Chris] Fizz pump? 
[Ryan] Yeah, "refizzinator". Yeah, fizz pump. 
[Eli] The Refizzinator.

183
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,740
I am the Refizzinator, and I bring you...fizzy!

184
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,620
[everyone laughing]

185
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,240
[Stuart] Fizzy!
[Eli singing] Two bottles at once!

186
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,340
[Barry] I think it's something like that, 'cause the ribs on the thing...I don't know if the...the nose thing would...I don't know.

187
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,060
[Eli] Let's see! I'm desperate to find out.
[Chris] I've forgotten who said what!

188
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,440
[Chris] It's to...It's actually for snoring, so...
[everyone] Oh!

189
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,980
[Barry] "Stuffy nose breathing apparatus".
[Paul, off-screen] Fifty points for Eli.

190
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,960
[Ryan] Man, you said for pollution and stuff! This is for when you're sleeping.

191
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,540
[Eli] Ah, it doesn't matter what it's for, it's what...you do with it.
[Chris] Well, it kind of does.

192
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,640
[Ryan] Wait, that's the point of the game. It does.
[Barry] How does that work?

193
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,520
[Eli] One point for me.
[Chris] It just opens up...your nostrils.

194
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,900
[Barry] Oh, so when you're sleeping at night, you get better breathing.

195
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
[man whispering] Wish.

196
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
[Barry] Oh!
[Chris] One of those.

197
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,240
[Barry] Ah...
[Ryan] "HelloDream".

198
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,640
[Ryan] That's...
[Barry] It is...a...toy.
[Stuart] Whoop.

199
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,080
[Stuart] I'm going to chuck my cock and...oh, God, no. I'm putting this bit of cardboard in.

200
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,500
[Eli] Invite the cock into the room.

201
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
[Chris laughs]

202
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah. I'm going to chuck my...

203
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,200
- [Stuart] Yeah.
- ...pointy cock in.

204
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,540
[Chris] Don't you want to guess what it is? You've all said, obviously think it's a cock thing...

205
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,260
[Eli] You stick your knob in it and it fellates...your missus.

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,760
And...the other bit is for stimulating something inside, I don't know if that's the prostate...

207
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,920
- It goes up your arse.
- [Stuart] Yeah.
- Is it...

208
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
[Eli] Goes in your vagina.

209
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,480
[Ryan] You know...you know those things where you stick your fingers...together, and you get stuck in them?
[Stuart] Ooh, like a Chinese finger trap!

210
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,340
Is it one of those, but for a man and a lady?

211
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,020
[Barry] I think it's a vagina in a can.

212
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,940
[Stuart] Yeah.
[Ryan] Oh.
[Eli] Liquid Ass.

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,340
[Ryan] But Hello...HelloDream sounds so soft, and tender, and nice! I don't think...
[Stuart] Yeah. They do things like that, especially Chinese pirates.

214
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,580
Yeah. You've got the Tenga Eggs, have you heard of those?

215
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,280
No.

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,580
They're like an egg, and you fuck it.

217
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,520
[Chris] I mean, guys...
[Stuart] So, like a normal egg.

218
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
[Ryan] Is that a handle to clip it on your belt?

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,380
[Stuart] Oh, that'd be great! [with another accent] Hey lads, look at that, I've just bought for you!
[Ryan] Oh, look what I've got!

220
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,680
Fancy Japanese fanny simulator here!

221
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,440
[Stuart] Maybe the top bit is for the lady, but I think that's unlikely, because...

222
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,680
[Eli] I'd have no clue.
[Stuart] You would have to...you wouldn't...

223
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,380
[Stuart] ...have a sex toy for both sexes.
[Barry] That's like a fluffer.
[Stuart] That's pointless.

224
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,920
[Stuart] So, I'm going for...
[Eli] It looks like it's got rabbit ears.

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,260
[Stuart and Ryan] Yeah.
[someone off-screen] Answers, please!
[Paul off-screen] Answers!

226
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,580
[Ryan] You know what?
[Chris] Well, I think they are comprehensively answering...

227
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,380
[Ryan] I'm going to say...the sexual equivalent of the finger binding thing, but for a man and a lady.

228
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,000
[Barry] Vagi-pot.

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,500
[Eli] I think those ear things inflate inside your bum.

230
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,500
[Paul laughs off-screen]
[Chris] I...I don't want to...

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,460
[Barry] Oh!
[Chris] ...say there is...
[Eli] That's about the size of an iPhone.

232
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,120
[Ryan] Is it a phone case?!? Oh, no.

233
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,280
[Chris] It's a fucking flask, guys!

234
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,580
[Barry laughs]
[Stuart] What?!?

235
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,040
[Chris] It's for putting...hot...liquids in.

236
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,920
[Eli] Ah!

237
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,620
[Eli] I could put my dick in that.

238
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,920
[Stuart] Well...
[Chris, whispering] Jesus Christ.

239
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,880
Unfortunately, due to the very wide shape of it, and it looking very short and small...

240
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,440
- How small is that flask? It's that big!
- [Eli] It's quite small, isn't it?
- [Stuart] Yeah!

241
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,100
- You get one Yoplait in it, you're done.
- Yeah!

242
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,720
Don't put your yoghurt in that! It's not for hot yoghurt! [everyone laughs]

243
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,300
- I've got a hot lassi with my name on it.
- [Paul laughs off-screen] The dog!

244
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,740
[everyone laughing]

245
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,960
[Stuart] Oh, my God.
[Chris, appalled] Guys, no points!

246
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,760
[man whispering] Wish.

247
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,200
[Barry] Is that a power button?

248
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,100
[Eli] Penis calibrator.
[Barry] Settings...

249
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,400
[Barry] That is, uh...a lighter.

250
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,600
[Stuart] Oh, God. So, it could be a musical sex toy, ...
[Barry] It actually says "a lighter".

251
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,640
- or it could be...a vape device or something that...
- [Eli] It looks like a vape, doesn't it?

252
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,340
- that's also an MP3 player or something? Umm...
- [Chris] All right.

253
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,800
I would go for...

254
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,260
home...

255
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,860
home...chemical...

256
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,680
home...chemical...tester.

257
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,820
[Paul, off-screen] You just said three words...
[Chris laughs]

258
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,900
[Barry] MP3 player.

259
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,220
[Stuart] Oh, my God! It does look like a DNA sequencer or something if you look at the thing, doesn't it?

260
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,880
[Stuart] Uhh...

261
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,940
[Stuart] Uhh... [imitates race car noise]

262
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
[imitates race car changing gears]

263
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,000
[imitates race car brake]

264
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,620
Umm...

265
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,960
[Barry] Settings...
[Stuart] In and Out settings...what?

266
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,100
[Stuart] And brightness.

267
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,140
[Stuart] Hang on!
[Chris] I need an answer.
[Stuart] Brightness, volume, in and out.

268
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,780
[Stuart] Sounds like the Agadoo!

269
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,520
- Umm...it's...it's...it's a vape, most probably a testing device.
- Is it a light that flashes in time with music?

270
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,840
[Chris] All really good answers; unfortunately, that is the sex toy.

271
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,120
[Stuart] Oh! I regret...

272
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,260
[Eli] "Masturbating Cup Hands"...
[Stuart] Should have stuck with it.

273
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,360
[running footsteps]
[Chris laughs]

274
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,160
[Stuart] It is literally a sex toy with a built-in...MP3 player.

275
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,640
[Chris] It's...It's...It's a pocket fanny, you can stick it to a hard surface if you want,

276
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,940
you stick your dick in it...

277
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,260
- ...basically.
- [Stuart] I like the way it says "ULTIMATE PISTON" on the side.

278
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,980
[Chris] What really confused me...
[Stuart] Ohh!
[Eli] Oh, my God.

279
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,820
[Chris] Okay, it heats up. You're going to stick your dick in something that comes from China and it heats up. Fine.

280
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,320
Apparently it's the same size, although bigger than a woman.

281
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,580
Also, it's got a no entry sign on it, when clearly the other picture shows you...

282
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,860
Also, it's got a no entry sign on it, when clearly the other picture shows you...entering it!

283
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,320
- There's...there's a lot about this advert I really don't understand.
- [Eli] "Auto Suck Masturbator".

284
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
- I think you're asking for an injury from that thing.
- [Eli] I wouldn't put mine in that.

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,520
[Barry] I did it for my Kitchen Gadget Testing there. That's a hot dog cooker! [laughs]

286
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,980
[Eli] Reminds me of that guy who...
[everyone laughs]

287
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,980
[Stuart] Oh, man.

288
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,180
[Eli] ...that guy who, uh...had sex with a Findus Crispy Pancake, he cooked his knob end.

289
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,300
[Barry] Really?
[Eli] Yeah.
[Stuart] Wow.

290
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Some guy fucked a pasty from Greggs, and sued them 'cause it burned his dick.

291
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,040
[Eli] Yeah.
[Chris] Wow.

292
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm going to guess the judge didn't rule in his favour.

293
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,940
No, he won.

294
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,280
- What?!?
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, God.

295
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,960
[Stuart clapping lightly]
[Paul, off-screen] Oh.

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,380
[everyone clapping]
[Paul] Ryan gets a complementary handjob from me later.

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,800
