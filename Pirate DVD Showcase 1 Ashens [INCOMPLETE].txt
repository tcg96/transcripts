- Bloody hell, DVDs are cheap these days, aren't they? You can pick them up for a few pounds and watch films to your leisure. But that's not cheap enough for some people, or maybe markets, where the official hand of the distributor has not really reached in. And, as such, there is a market for fake DVDs in China, Malaysia and other such places. And tell you what? We're going to point and laugh at some ones which aren't very good now. Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Stuart.
- I brought my friend Alec along, who is a connoisseur of things that aren't very good and also of DVDs that aren't quite proper.

- Let's begin with everybody's favourite Star Wars film: "Star Wars Episo pe II: Attack of the Clones".
- It's the best of the prequels, I think.
- Absolutely. Episode II, I hated, but Episo pe II...it really had something to it. This is, of course, the "Widescreen Dight Signature Seletion"...as in...what other version would you want?
- It's better than full-frame.
- There's some writing at the bottom I can't read. On the spine, you've got the tell-tale...crease along the middle. We'll explain that later.
- Yeah, we'll come back to the crease.
- On the back, "Widescreen edition enhanced for 16:9". Nice, nice, I can live with that. "Audioia, English 5.1 Dolby Digital and French. Brian Helgeland and Paul Bethany"...happened to be in the studio, and we brought them in to have a chat about this film, for some reason.
- Paul Bethany is a special feature.
- He's just in the box.
- "Not just an actor, but a special feature."
- "Deleted Scenes with Fitmaker's", no, "Fitmmaker's Intros". It's nice for them to take the time out to make so many fitmms, to give us an intro. "Exclusive Knight's Tale 3D Screen Saver". I would put a lot of money on that not being on the disc.
- Yeah. For recollection, the extra features on this were pretty...pretty light.
- "Widescreen presentation, cast, filmography, music video, and DVD-ROM includes". I'll bet it does. Oh, God, there's some more flavour text at the bottom. "Begin your Star Wars DVD collection with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menaace! Packed with over six hours of additional material"...no, "matrial", sorry. If you're running out of matrial, it's the perfect way to get more. "The breathtaking scope of George Luce's"... Ah, that's why the prequels aren't very good! It wasn't Lucas, it was George Luce! So much has just been explained. Absolutely perfect. And locked to Region 1, I'll bet it isn't.
- The video is a tele-cine, it's ripped from a cinema reel, but there are several points where the audio cuts out or is replaced with static, but that means you'll get less of Hayden Christensen's dialogues.
- That's fantastic! That's the bonus feature they should be bloody advertising!
- "Contains less Hayden Christensen".
- I want that version now, if not sooner.

- Now, we're going to show you a slightly different format. This is how you often get these things packaged: just in a bag, with the DVD case, or DVD inlay, even, folded in half, hence why you get...the line up the middle.
- The wonderful crease.
- The wonderful crease, that is your guarantee of quality.
- You know what else is your guarantee of quality? The fact that this is on a dual-layer DVD!
- Oh, look at that. I bet it really is. I like how they put that on like it's some sort of amazing thing we should all be impressed with. So this is King Arthur, starring Arthur, "Lencelot", and Guinevere. Grown a little more stubble since I last remember seeing it. I seem to recall this film being a bit dull. I slightly remember being too bored in the cinema, and that I could have spent eight quid on something else, really. I think that is the correct text on the back?!? That's amazing. Then, my eyes kind of wandered downwards a bit..."Buena Vista Pictures presents a Borg Coules production, a Nick Cassavettes film, Denzel Washington in John Q". So, I think...I have a theory here. This film was so boring, that they're giving you the credits to a much better film, so you can go and watch that instead.
- Unfortunately, having watched the DVD that comes with this, I can confirm that Denzel Washington isn't in it.
- ...Not interested now. Go away, King Arthur.

- And now half of you are thinking it, but yes, it is entirely true: there is a rip-off version of Ashens and the Quest for the Game Child. I shit you not. It came in one of these bags...and had a disc with it, but the person did not send the disc in case they got done by customs. But they did send me a nice rip of it, which I will show in a moment. Apparently, this includes both unrated and theatrical versions, which is amazing, because there is no unrated version, so they edited their own one in, with extra scenes.
- I think so. Maybe they put Denzel Washington in it.
- Excellent! Just replace me with him digitally, but really badly, just like a static MSPaint head floating. On the spine, something we can't quite wrap our heads around, is that they've inexplicably put a Warner Bros. logo or something with "SHU" over it. Shu. Sheffield Hallam University.
- Stuart Has Uncles.
- I do...It's true, I do, but not enough to use that as advertising. That's really weird. Do you think the person who made the copy wants to be known for it?
- They deserve all the credit, to be fair.
- On the back, I like that these are shots from the film, and this is from some promo material, sort of me and Robert Llewellyn. "Featuring Ashen's insane quest for the Game Child, accompanied by fan-favourite Chef Excellence -- a human version, not the bloody puppet -- and together they overcome all odds", and all common sense, "to lay our hands"... Oh, God, they're in it as well. "on the fabled Game Child. But a shadowy figure, aided by my irritating nemesis, tried to take the game for their own dastardly..." I think I know where that flavour text comes from. I think it's from the IndieGoGo campaign.
- Yeah, could be.
- Special Features: "Exclusive Featurette"... I don't know what, but it's exclusive. "Deleted Scenes". The unknown featurette. "Commentary and Interviews". Most of those things were not on the original version, none of those things were on this version.
- But this version was presented by Screen Australia.
- It was. On the bottom, "Stuart Ashen, Warwick Davis, Robert Llewellyn", that's all correct. Not so correct, "Produced by Ibarra"? "Original music by David Morgan"? "Cinematography by Soykut Turan"? "Film editing by Erhan Acar Jr."? I don't know any of these people!
- They made your movie, though!
- Apparently so! I must have been looking the other way. My favourite is "Produced by Mr. Akino". Sounds like the name of a character from an old Japanese game. And the most inexplicable of all: "Make-up Department: Stuart Ashen and Riyad Barmania". Me and Riyad did not do the make-up, I cannot stress that enough. I don't even know if that web address is correct.
- I'm guessing it doesn't have the spaces in it, even if it is.
- That's extremely accurate. "Languages, English and French". No, there is no French dub of it. "Subtitles", no there are no subtitles, because they cost too much to put on. "Aspect ratio 1.85:1". Nope, it was 2.35:1. The time is not far off, we were at 89 minutes.
- Digital sound, by the way.
- Yes, it did have digital sound, because we encoded it digitally. It's nice to feel wanted. The irony is that this one came with neither a DVD nor a Blu-Ray; it came with a CD, that they had horribly compressed the movie onto! So it's like watching 240p YouTube from bloody 1996.
- You can watch it for free on YouTube, as well.
- Yes. You can watch it for free in 1080p, or you can spend money to watch a slightly extended albeit 240p version, on a fucking CD. Thanks, lads. Well, you know you've made it when people want to rip your stuff off. And yet they rip mine off anyway.

- Right. Die Another Day, everybody's favourite Bond film, except people who have watched it. What was your favourite bit? Mine was the invisible car that made me puke blood.
- I quite liked the end credits.
- They were good.
- Thematically, they felt the most like a Bond movie.
- It also meant we could leave. So this film stars James Bond, Jinx, Miranda Frost, Zao, and Gustav Graves.
- James Bond playing Pierce Brosnan in this film. He has an inexplicably shiny head!
- He does! Was the make-up person on the day off or something? What worries me the most is that he looks like he's some sort of conjoined twin with Halle Berry. 
- Is Miranda Frost melting his head with her mind?
- I think so. I think she thought she was Emma Frost, and used her psychic powers. I like just reading this across: Bond Jinx Frost Zao Graves!
- See the movie!
- It's a movie, you'll like it...well, you won't like it, it's this one. On the back we've got some dodgy photoshopping orbs, of old Zao with his diamonds in his face, because it was that kind of film. So here's the synopsis for people who haven't seen Die Another Day. "Based Upon: This is, of course, the latest in the James Bond series, following The World Is Not Enough. This is Brosnan's fourth time as Bond in the Broccoli series, expected to be his last. Premise: Not much is known about the premise yet"...which is weird, because we've got the disc..."except that it revolves around a North Korean leader, Yune, who uses an experimental facial mutation device that allows him to take on new appearances -- turning into Stephens"! ... Shit, I'd see that! This machine can turn you into anyone you want, as long as they're called Stephen!
- My name is Bond, Stephen Bond.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen Bond. So you can like turn into Stephen Merchant but not Ricky Gervais. "Turning into Stephens". What a great name for a coming-of-age drama. Presumably, Stephens is one of the actors.
- You'd hope!
- "Until it goes wrong, leaving his face" looking like an Ian. "Until it goes wrong, leaving his face half mutilated." That doesn't even happen in the film! ... James Bond and the infinite Stephens. "Madonna plays a fencing instructor, Madsen and Berry play US secret agents". Blimey. What is the disc like?
- They've spelt the name of the film right, which helps.
- Oh, that's good.
- "Die Another Da".
- "Die Another Da"? Is that a threat to a Welsh father?
- "Die Another Da"?
- What was the actual quality like, Alec?
- Oh, dear.
- Not very good?
- This was very compressed, and only half of it is visible, so the credits simply say "other Day". 
- Did they film the screen, but only half of it?
- Yeah. It's the right-hand side of the screen. So sometimes you get, you know, Pierce Brosnan's shoulder. It's clearly ripped from a VCD, because the film stops halfway through, and you have to select the second half.
- Which is where it would be on the second disc. How did they manage to only show you half of a video CD?
- It makes it better.
- It does. You can imagine the other half with Sean Connery in it. I must say though, the quality of the disc is astonishing! It even says Die Another Day printed on it, look! And it's a proper pressed disc and everything! But yeah, not sounding good. Does the menu work?
- Oh, yeah, it does work. It's a thing of terrible beauty.
- But it does lead you into half a film, quite literally. I'm going to phone everybody I know called Stephen, and ask if they're secretly a North Korean man, masquerading.
- Do you want to be in a James Bond movie?
- You've just got to be called Stephen, that's all you need.
