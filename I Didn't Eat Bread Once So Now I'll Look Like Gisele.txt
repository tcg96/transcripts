- It'll be like this flowy silky thing, and, like, when I fold it out like this, it'll look like I have wings and stuff. It'll be really...
- Hey, guys. Um...Can I have everyone's attention for a second?
- I mean, I was just describing my dream cape, but sure, whatever. 
- Thank you. Um...I just wanted to prepare you guys for some physical changes that I'll be going through in the near future. Umm...This weekend, I was at a restaurant and I...didn't eat the bread. 
- Holy shit.
- What?
- So, needless to say, I'm going to have Gisele's body like, any day or minute now.
- Oh my God, wow, congratulations.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I was in the bathroom and I heard gasps, what did I miss?
- Kassia didn't eat the bread one time.
- So you could have Gisele's body like, any minute now.
- Yeah.
- Uh!
- So cool!
- Wait, tell us the whole story. Like, we gotta hear every detail about this not eating the bread one time miracle. I mean, where were you?
- So, I was having dinner at Gene's Not So Lean's Italian Cuisines.
- I love that place, one of those with the S after Lean.
- Great bathrooms...
- Okay, shut up. Who were you with?
- No one.
- What?
- Toute seule. So that makes it all the more enticing to eat the bread, because you have to kill the lonely.
- When the bread came to your table, you just...?
- Didn't eat it.
- Well, ****.
- This is incredible!
- I cannot wrap my mind around this not eating the bread one time thing!
- Are you trying right now?
- I'm trying! ... Nope, just can't do it. I cannot believe it.
- I have no idea. ... What did you eat? 
- Ooh.
- I ordered spaghetti bolognese, extra gnese. Oh, and that was another thing: they forgot the extra gnese at first, so I had to send it back. 
- What the fuck?
- So that was another full fifteen minutes of me not eating the bread.
- No.
- ... My Gisele body hasn't popped on yet, but I'm sure it will any minute now. 
- Of course, Kassia. You not eating the bread that one time was more heroic than our soldiers. 
- Well, I don't know. 
- Kassia, this package came for you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, bread!
- Yeah!
- I ordered a bunch of stuff off Amazon when I realized I would have Gisele's body any second now. Plus, I love the fact that she's, like, from the Amazon.
- Yes, yes!
- So this is all I'll wear now: bikinis, string bikinis...
- You've got it, flaunt it.
- Mmm-hmm.
- This is where I'll work now, so...
- Oh, cool.
- And, of course, I love the Patriots now, ...
- It's a football team.
- ...or shall I say, ...well, I have to practice Brazilian before I can use it. 
- Kassia, are you saying you think you're going to become Gisele?
- It was warm bread and a whipped tiny butter that I forwent. 
- Then, that's it. You're going to become Gisele. 
- Yeah, and she will become me and get this body. 
- Actually, in that case, do you mind if I, um...? I'm just going to, ah...
- Is that...?
- For Tom Brady?
- Yeah. I want to fuck Tom Brady.
