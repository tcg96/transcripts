- Excuse me, I'm looking for the organic basil. Where is it?
- ...Oh, I'm not sure.
- That's not an acceptable answer.
- I don't...I don't know what--
- Go get your manager, pronto.
- I'm sorry, I--
- "I'm sorry, I--" Saying "I'm sorry" means nothing to me, because if you were sorry, you would actually do your job. Go get a manager.
- Okay. If you'd just follow me...
- This isn't "follow the leader". You don't need to treat me like I'm in elementary school, okay?
- Okay.
- I need you to go get it and bring it back to me nyow.
- Okay.

- ...Where is this jagaloon?

- Just stop. Okay. Excuse me sir, are you a manager?
- Yes.
- This woman called me the most racist, sexist, classist name that you could possibly call a white woman.
- Wait, who-- what?
- She just called me a...Karen...because I'm a white woman with class.
- Okay ma'am, I've never seen this woman before in my life.
- ...
- What-- so you don't even know your employees?
- Karen, I don't work here!
- Of course you do.
- No, she definitely does not work here.
- So you just messed with me for fun?
- Yeah!
- Well, I'm calling the health department.
- Health de-- why?
- For race-- sexis-- classism.
